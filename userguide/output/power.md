  Restart Warning Message


An additional warning message appears when a restart is attempted when
a scrub or resilver is in progress. When that warning appears, the
recommended steps are to :guilabel:`CANCEL` the restart request and to
periodically run :command:`zpool status` from :ref:`Shell` until it
shows that the scrub or verify has completed. Then the restart request
can be entered again.

To complete the restart request, click the :guilabel:`Confirm`
checkbox and then the :guilabel:`RESTART` button. Restarting the system
disconnects all clients, including the web administration interface.
Wait a few minutes for the system to boot, then use the back button in
the browser to return to the IP address of the FreeNAS\ :sup:`速` system. The
login screen appears after a successful reboot. If the login screen
does not appear, using a monitor and keyboard to physically access the
FreeNAS\ :sup:`速` system is required to determine the issue preventing the
system from resuming normal operation.
