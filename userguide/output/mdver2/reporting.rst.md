Reporting
=========

`Figure %s <reporting_graphs_fig>`. Choose a category from the drop-down
menu to view those graphs. There are also options to change the graph
view and number of graphs on each page.

FreeNAS<sup>Â®</sup> uses [collectd][] to provide reporting statistics.
For a clearer picture, hover over a point in the graph to show exact
numbers for that point in time. Use the magnifier buttons next to each
graph to increase or decrease the displayed time increment from 10
minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. The `<<` and `>>` buttons
scroll through the output.

Reporting graphs do not appear if there is no related data.

Graphs are grouped by category on the Reporting page:

-   `CPU`

    -   [CPU][] shows the amount of time spent by the CPU in various
        states such as executing user code, executing system code, and
        being idle. Graphs of short-, mid-, and long-term load are
        shown, along with CPU temperature graphs.

-   `Disk`

    -   [Disk][] shows read and write statistics on I/O, percent busy,
        latency, operations per second, pending I/O requests, and disk
        temperature. Choose the `DEVICES` and `METRICS` to view the
        selected metrics for the chosen devices.

    Temperature monitoring for the disk is disabled if `HDD Standby` is
    enabled in `Disks`.

    </div>

-   `Memory`

    -   [Memory][] displays memory usage.
    -   [Swap][] displays the amount of free and used swap space.

-   `Network`

    -   [Interface][] shows received and transmitted traffic in
        megabytes per second for each configured interface.

-   `NFS`

    -   [NFS][] shows information about the number of procedure calls
        for each procedure and whether the system is a server or client.

-   `Partition`

    -   [Disk space][] displays free, used, and reserved space for each
        pool and dataset. However, the disk space used by an individual
        zvol is not displayed as it is a block device.

-   `System`

    -   [Processes][] displays the number of processes. It is grouped by
        state.

-   `Target`

    -   Target shows bandwidth statistics for iSCSI ports.

-   `UPS`

    -   [UPS][] displays statistics about an uninterruptible power
        supply (UPS) using [Network UPS tools][]. Statistics include
        voltages, currents, power, frequencies, load, and temperatures.

-   `ZFS`

    -   [ZFS][] shows compressed physical ARC size, hit ratio, demand
        data, demand metadata, and prefetch data.
