10. Storage
***********

The Storage section of the web interface allows configuration of these
options:

* Swap Space: Change the swap space size.

* Pools: create and manage storage pools.

* Snapshots: manage local snapshots.

* VMware-Snapshots: coordinate OpenZFS snapshots with a VMware
  datastore.

* Disks: view and manage disk options.

* Importing a Disk: import a **single** disk that is formatted with
  the UFS, NTFS, MSDOS, or EXT2 filesystem.

* Multipaths: View multipath information for systems with compatible
  hardware.


10.1. Swap Space
================

Swap is space on a disk set aside to be used as memory. When the
FreeNAS^® system runs low on memory, less-used data can be "swapped"
onto the disk, freeing up main memory.

For reliability, FreeNAS^® creates swap space as mirrors of swap
partitions on pairs of individual disks. For example, if the system
has three hard disks, a swap mirror is created from the swap
partitions on two of the drives. The third drive is not used, because
it does not have redundancy. On a system with four drives, two swap
mirrors are created.

Swap space is allocated when drives are partitioned before being added
to a vdev. A 2 GiB partition for swap space is created on each data
drive by default. The size of space to allocate can be changed in
System ‣ Advanced in the *Swap size in Gib* field. Changing the value
does not affect the amount of swap on existing disks, only disks added
after the change. This does not affect log or cache devices, which are
created without swap. Swap can be disabled by entering *0*, but that
is **strongly discouraged**.


10.2. Pools
===========

Storage ‣ Pools is used to create and manage ZFS pools, datasets, and
zvols.

Proper storage design is important for any NAS. **Please read through
this entire chapter before configuring storage disks. Features are
described to help make it clear which are beneficial for particular
uses, and caveats or hardware restrictions which limit usefulness.**


10.2.1. Creating Pools
----------------------

Before creating a pool, determine the level of required redundancy,
how many disks will be added, and if any data exists on those disks.
Creating a pool overwrites disk data, so save any required data to
different media before adding disks to a pool.

Go to Storage ‣ Pools and click ADD. Select Create new pool and click
CREATE POOL to open the screen shown in Figure %s.

   [image]Creating a Pool

Enter a name for the pool in the Name field. Ensure that the chosen
name conforms to these naming conventions. Choosing a name that will
stick out in the logs is recommended, rather than generic names like
"data" or "freenas".

To encrypt data on the underlying disks as a protection against
physical theft, set the Encryption option. A dialog displays a
reminder to back up the encryption key. The data on the disks is
inaccessible without the key. Select Confirm then click I UNDERSTAND.

Warning:

  Refer to the warnings in Managing Encrypted Pools before enabling
  encryption!

From the Available Disks section, select disks to add to the pool.
Enter a value in Filter disks by name or Filter disks by capacity to
change the displayed disk order. These fields support PCRE regular
expressions for filtering. For example, to show only *da* and *nvd*
disks in Available Disks, type "^(da)|(nvd)" in Filter disks by name.

Type and maximum capacity is displayed for available disks. To show
the disk *Rotation Rate*, *Model*, and *Serial*, click  (Expand).

After selecting disks, click the right arrow to add them to the Data
VDevs section. The usable space of each disk in a vdev is limited to
the size of the smallest disk in the vdev. Additional data vdevs must
have the same configuration as the initial vdev.

Any disks that appear in Data VDevs are used to create the pool. To
remove a disk from that section, select the disk and click the left
arrow to return it to the Available Disks section.

After adding one data vdev, additional data vdevs can be added with
REPEAT. This creates additional vdevs of the same layout as the
initial vdev. Select the number of additional vdevs and click REPEAT
VDEV.

RESET LAYOUT returns all disks to the Available Disks area and closes
all but one Data VDevs table.

SUGGEST LAYOUT arranges all disks in an optimal layout for both
redundancy and capacity.

The pool layout is dependent upon the number of disks added to Data
VDevs and the number of available layouts increases as disks are
added. To view the available layouts, ensure that at least one disk
appears in Data VDevs and select the drop-down menu under this
section. The web interface will automatically update the Estimated
total raw data capacity when a layout is selected. These layouts are
supported:

* **Stripe:** requires at least one disk

* **Mirror:** requires at least two disks

* **RAIDZ1:** requires at least three disks

* **RAIDZ2:** requires at least four disks

* **RAIDZ3:** requires at least five disks

Warning:

  Refer to the ZFS Primer for more information on redundancy and disk
  layouts. When more than five disks are used, consideration must be
  given to the optimal layout for the best performance and
  scalability.It is important to realize that different layouts of
  virtual devices (*vdevs*) affect which operations can be performed
  on that pool later. For example, drives can be added to a mirror to
  increase redundancy, but that is not possible with RAIDZ arrays.

After the desired layout is configured, click CREATE. A dialog shows a
reminder that all disk contents will be erased. Click Confirm, then
CREATE POOL to create the pool.

Note:

  To instead preserve existing data, click the CANCEL button and refer
  to Importing a Disk and Importing a Pool to see if the existing
  format is supported. If so, perform that action instead. If the
  current storage format is not supported, it is necessary to back up
  the data to external media, create the pool, then restore the data
  to the new pool.

Depending on the size and number of disks, the type of controller, and
whether encryption is selected, creating the pool may take some time.
If the Encryption option was selected, a dialog provides a link to
Download Recovery Key. Click the link and save the key to a safe
location. When finished, click DONE.

Figure %s shows the new *pool1*.

Select the pool to see more information. The first entry in the list
represents the root dataset and has the same name as the pool.

The Available column shows the estimated storage space before
compression. The Used column shows the estimated space used after
compression. These numbers come from **zfs list**.

Other utilities can report different storage estimates. For example,
the available space shown in **zpool status** is the cumulative space
of all drives in the pool, regardless of pool configuration or
compression.

Other information shown is the type of compression, the compression
ratio, whether it is mounted as read-only, whether deduplication has
been enabled, the mountpoint path, and any comments entered for the
pool.

Pool status is indicated by one of these symbols:


Pool Status
^^^^^^^^^^^

+-------------------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| Symbol            | Color    | Meaning                               |
|===================|==========|=======================================|
|  HEALTHY         | Green    | The pool is healthy.                  |
+-------------------+----------+---------------------------------------+
|  DEGRADED        | Orange   | The pool is in a degraded state.      |
+-------------------+----------+---------------------------------------+
|  UNKNOWN         | Blue     | Pool status cannot be determined.     |
+-------------------+----------+---------------------------------------+
|  LOCKED          | Yellow   | The pool is locked.                   |
+-------------------+----------+---------------------------------------+
|  Pool Fault      | Red      | The pool has a critical error.        |
+-------------------+----------+---------------------------------------+

There is an option to Upgrade Pool. This upgrades the pool to the
latest ZFS Feature Flags. See the warnings in Upgrading a ZFS Pool
before selecting this option. This button does not appear when the
pool is running the latest version of the feature flags.

   [image]Viewing Pools

Creating a pool adds a card to the Dashboard. Available space, disk
details, and pool status is shown on the card. The background color of
the card indicates the pool status:

* Green: healthy or locked

* Yellow: unknown, offline, or degraded

* Red: faulted or removed


10.2.2. Managing Encrypted Pools
--------------------------------

FreeNAS^® uses GELI full disk encryption for ZFS pools. This type of
encryption is intended to protect against the risks of data being read
or copied when the system is powered down, when the pool is locked, or
when disks are physically stolen.

FreeNAS^® encrypts disks and pools, not individual filesystems. The
partition table on each disk is not encrypted, but only identifies the
location of partitions on the disk. On an encrypted pool, the data in
each partition is encrypted. These are generally called "encrypted
drives", even though the partition table is not encrypted. To use
drive firmware to completely encrypt the drive, see Self-Encrypting
Drives.

Note:

  Processors with support for the AES-NI instruction set are strongly
  recommended. These processors can handle encryption of a small
  number of disks with negligible performance impact. They also retain
  performance better as the number of disks increases. Older
  processors without the AES-NI instructions see significant
  performance impact with even a single encrypted disk. This forum
  post compares the performance of various processors.

All drives in an encrypted pool are encrypted, including L2ARC (read
cache) and SLOG (write cache). Drives added to an existing encrypted
pool are encrypted with the same method specified when the pool was
created. Data in memory, including ARC, is not encrypted. ZFS data on
disk, including L2ARC and SLOG, are encrypted if the underlying disks
are encrypted. Swap data on disk is always encrypted.

Encryption performance depends upon the number of disks encrypted. The
more drives in an encrypted pool, the more encryption and decryption
overhead, and the greater the impact on performance. **Encrypted pools
composed of more than eight drives can suffer severe performance
penalties**. Please benchmark encrypted pools before using them in
production.

Creating an encrypted pool means GELI encrypts the data on the disk
and generates a *master key* to decrypt this data. This master key is
also encrypted. Loss of a disk master key due to disk corruption is
equivalent to any other disk failure, and in a redundant pool, other
disks will contain accessible copies of the uncorrupted data. While it
is *possible* to separately back up disk master keys, it is usually
not necessary or useful.

There are two *user keys* that can be used to unlock the master key
and then decrypt the disks. In FreeNAS^®, these user keys are named
the **encryption key** and the **recovery key**. Because data cannot
be read without first providing a key, encrypted disks containing
sensitive data can be safely removed, reused, or discarded without
secure wiping or physical destruction of the media.

When discarding disks that still contain encrypted sensitive data, the
encryption and recovery keys should also be destroyed or securely
deleted. Keys that are not destroyed must be stored securely and kept
physically separate from the discarded disks. Data is vulnerable to
decryption when the encryption key is present with the discarded disks
or can be obtained by the same person who gains access to the disks.

This encryption method is **not** designed to protect against
unauthorized access when the pool is already unlocked. Before
sensitive data is stored on the system, ensure that only authorized
users have access to the web interface and that permissions with
appropriate restrictions are set on shares.

Here are some important points about FreeNAS^® behavior to remember
when creating or using an encrypted pool:

* At present, there is no one-step way to encrypt an existing pool.
  The data must be copied to an existing or new encrypted pool. After
  that, the original pool and any unencrypted backup should be
  destroyed to prevent unauthorized access and any disks that
  contained unencrypted data should be wiped.

* Hybrid pools are not supported. Added vdevs must match the existing
  encryption scheme. Extending a Pool automatically encrypts a new
  vdev being added to an existing encrypted pool.

* FreeNAS^® encryption differs from the encryption used in the Oracle
  proprietary version of ZFS. To convert between these formats, both
  pools must be unlocked, and the data copied between them.

* Each pool has a separate encryption key. Pools can also add a unique
  recovery key to use if the passphrase is forgotten or encryption key
  invalidated.

* Encryption applies to a pool, not individual users. The data from an
  unlocked pool is accessible to all users with permissions to access
  it. Encrypted pools with a passphrase can be locked on demand by
  users that know the passphrase. Pools are automatically locked when
  the system is shut down.

* Encrypted data cannot be accessed when the disks are removed or the
  system has been shut down. On a running system, encrypted data
  cannot be accessed when the pool is locked.

* Encrypted pools that have no passphrase are unlocked at startup.
  Pools with a passphrase remain locked until a user enters the
  passphrase to unlock them.


10.2.2.1. Encryption and Recovery Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeNAS^® generates a randomized *encryption key* whenever a new
encrypted pool is created. This key is stored in the system dataset.
It is the primary key used to unlock the pool each time the system
boots. Creating a passphrase for the pool adds a passphrase component
to the encryption key and allows the pool to be locked.

A pool encryption key backup can be downloaded to allow disk
decryption on a different system in the event of failure or to allow
the FreeNAS^® stored key to be deleted for extra security. The
combination of encryption key location and passphrase usage provide
several different security scenarios:

* *Key stored locally, no passphrase*: the encrypted pool is decrypted
  and accessible when the system running. Protects "data at rest"
  only.

* *Key stored locally, with passphrase*: the encrypted pool is not
  accessible until the passphrase is entered by the FreeNAS^®
  administrator.

* *Key not stored locally*: the encrypted pool is not accessible until
  the FreeNAS^® administrator uploads the key file. When the key also
  has a passphrase, it must be provided with the key file.

Encrypted pools cannot be locked in the web interface until a
passphrase is created for the encryption key.

The recovery key is an optional keyfile that is generated by
FreeNAS^®, provided for download, and wiped from the system. It is
designed as an emergency backup to unlock or import an encrypted pool
if the passphrase is forgotten or the encryption key is somehow
invalidated. This file is not stored anywhere on the FreeNAS^® system
and only one recovery key can exist for each encrypted pool. Adding a
new recovery key invalidates any previously downloaded recovery key
file for that pool.

Existing encryption or recovery keys can be invalidated in several
situations:

* An encryption re-key invalidates all encryption and recovery keys as
  well as an existing passphrase.

* Using a recovery key file to import an encrypted pool invalidates
  the existing encryption key and passphrase for that pool. FreeNAS^®
  generates a new encryption key for the imported pool, but a new
  passphrase must be created before the pool can be locked.

* Creating or changing a passphrase invalidates any existing recovery
  key.

* Adding a new recovery key invalidates any existing recovery key
  files for the pool.

* Extending a Pool invalidates all encryption and recovery keys as
  well as an existing passphrase.

Be sure to download and securely store copies of the most current
encryption and recovery keys. Protect and backup encryption key
passphrases. **Losing the encryption and recovery keys or the
passphrase can result in irrevocably losing all access to the data
stored in the encrypted pool!**


10.2.2.2. Encryption Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encryption operations are seen by clicking  (Encryption Options) for
the encrypted pool in Storage ‣ Pools. These options are available:

* Lock: Only appears after a passphrase is created. Locking a pool
  restricts data accessability in FreeNAS^® until the pool is
  unlocked. Selecting this action requires entering the passphrase.
  The pool status changes to "LOCKED", Pool Operations are limited to
  *Export/Disconnect*, and  (Encryption Options) changes to 
  (Unlock).

* Unlock: Decrypt the pool by clicking  (Unlock) and entering the
  passphrase *or* uploading the recovery key file. Only the passphrase
  is used when both a passphrase and a recovery key are entered. The
  services listed in Restart Services restart when the pool is
  unlocked. This enables FreeNAS^® to begin accessing the decrypted
  data. Individual services can be prevented from restarting by
  opening Restart Services and deselecting them. Deselecting services
  can prevent them from properly accessing the unlocked pool.

* Encryption Key/Passphrase: Create or change the encryption key
  passphrase and download a backup of the encryption key. Unlike a
  password, a passphrase can contain spaces and is typically a series
  of words. A good passphrase is easy to remember but hard to guess.

     [image]Encryption Key/Passphrase Options

  The administrator password is required for encryption key changes.
  Setting Remove Passphrase invalidates the current pool passphrase.
  Creating or changing a passphrase invalidates the pool recovery key.

* Recovery Key: Generate and download a new recovery key file or
  invalidate an existing recovery key. The FreeNAS^® administrative
  password is required. Generating a new recovery key file invalidates
  previously downloaded recovery key files for the pool.

* Reset Keys: Reset the encryption on the pool GELI master key and
  invalidate all encryption keys, recovery keys, and any passphrase
  for the pool. A dialog opens to save a backup of the new encryption
  key. A new passphrase can be created and a new pool recovery key
  file can be downloaded. The administrator password is required to
  reset pool encryption.

  If a key reset fails on a multi-disk system, an alert is generated.
  **Do not ignore this alert** as doing so may result in the loss of
  data.


10.2.3. Adding Cache or Log Devices
-----------------------------------

Pools can be used either during or after pool creation to add an SSD
as a cache or log device to improve performance of the pool under
specific use cases. Before adding a cache or log device, refer to the
ZFS Primer to determine if the system will benefit or suffer from the
addition of the device.

To add a Cache or Log device during pool creation, click the Add Cache
or Add Log button. Select the disk from Available Disks and use the
right arrow next to Cache VDev or Log VDev to add it to that section.

To add a device to an existing pool, Extend that pool.


10.2.4. Removing Cache or Log Devices
-------------------------------------

Cache or log devices can be removed by going to Storage ‣ Pools.
Choose the desired pool and click  (Settings) ‣ Status. Choose the
log or cache device to remove, then click  (Options) ‣ Remove.


10.2.5. Adding Spare Devices
----------------------------

ZFS provides the ability to have "hot" *spares*. These are drives that
are connected to a pool, but not in use. If the pool experiences the
failure of a data drive, the system uses the hot spare as a temporary
replacement. If the failed drive is replaced with a new drive, the hot
spare drive is no longer needed and reverts to being a hot spare. If
the failed drive is detached from the pool, the spare is promoted to a
full member of the pool.

Hot spares can be added to a pool during or after creation. On
FreeNAS^®, hot spare actions are implemented by zfsd(8).

To add a spare during pool creation, click the Add Spare. button.
Select the disk from Available Disks and use the right arrow next to
Spare VDev to add it to the section.

To add a device to an existing pool, Extend that pool.


10.2.6. Extending a Pool
------------------------

To increase the capacity of an existing pool, click the pool name, 
(Settings), then Extend.

If the existing pool is encrypted, an additional warning message shows
a reminder that **extending a pool resets the passphrase and recovery
key**. Extending an encrypted pool opens a dialog to download the new
encryption key file. Remember to use the Encryption Operations to set
a new passphrase and create a new recovery key file.

When adding disks to increase the capacity of a pool, ZFS supports the
addition of virtual devices, or *vdevs*, to an existing ZFS pool.
**After a vdev is created, more drives cannot be added to that vdev**,
but a new vdev can be striped with another of the **same type** to
increase the overall size of the pool. To extend a pool, the vdev
being added must be the same type as existing vdevs. The EXTEND button
is only enabled when the vdev being added is the same type as the
existing vdevs. Some vdev extending examples:

* to extend a ZFS mirror, add the same number of drives. The result is
  a striped mirror. For example, if ten new drives are available, a
  mirror of two drives could be created initially, then extended by
  adding another mirror of two drives, and repeating three more times
  until all ten drives have been added.

* to extend a three-drive RAIDZ1, add another three drives. The
  resulting pool is a stripe of two RAIDZ1 vdevs, similar to RAID 50
  on a hardware controller.

* to extend a four-drive RAIDZ2, add another four drives. The result
  is a stripe of RAIDZ2 vdevs, similar to RAID 60 on a hardware
  controller.


10.2.7. Export/Disconnect a Pool
--------------------------------

Export/Disconnect is used to cleanly disconnect a pool from the
system. This is used before physically disconnecting the pool so it
can be imported on another system, or to optionally detach and erase
the pool so the disks can be reused.

To export or destroy an existing pool, click the pool name, 
(Settings), then Export/Disconnect. A dialog shows which system
Services will be disrupted by exporting the pool and additional
warnings for encrypted pools. Keep or erase the contents of the pool
by setting the options shown in Figure %s.

      [image]Export/Disconnect a Pool

Warning:

  Do not export/disconnect an encrypted pool if the passphrase has not
  been set! **An encrypted pool cannot be reimported without a
  passphrase!** When in doubt, use the instructions in Managing
  Encrypted Pools to set a passphrase.

The Export/Disconnect Pool screen provides these options:


Export/Disconnect Pool Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Setting                             | Description                           |
|=====================================|=======================================|
| Destroy data on this pool?          | Destroy all data on the disks in the  |
|                                     | pool. **This action cannot be         |
|                                     | undone**.                             |
+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Delete configuration of shares      | Delete any share configurations set   |
|                                     | up on the pool.                       |
+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Confirm export/disconnect           | Confirm the export/disconnect         |
|                                     | operation.                            |
+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+

If the pool is encrypted, DOWNLOAD KEY is also shown to download the
encryption key for that pool.

To Export/Disconnect the pool and keep the data and configurations of
shares, set **only** Confirm export/disconnect and click
EXPORT/DISCONNECT.

To instead destroy the data and share configurations on the pool, also
set the Destroy data on this pool? option. To verify that data on the
pool is to be destroyed, type the name of the pool and click
EXPORT/DISCONNECT. Data on the pool is destroyed, including share
configuration, zvols, datasets, and the pool itself. The disk is
returned to a raw state.

Danger:

  Before destroying a pool, ensure that any needed data has been
  backed up to a different pool or system.


10.2.8. Importing a Pool
------------------------

A pool that has been exported and disconnected from the system can be
reconnected with Storage ‣ Pools ‣ Add, then selecting Import an
existing pool. This works for pools that were exported/disconnected
from the current system, created on another system, or to reconnect a
pool after reinstalling the FreeNAS^® system.

When physically installing ZFS pool disks from another system, use the
"zpool export *poolname*" command or a web interface equivalent to
export the pool on that system. Then shut it down and connect the
drives to the FreeNAS^® system. This prevents an "in use by another
machine" error during the import to FreeNAS^®.

Existing ZFS pools can be imported by clicking Storage ‣ Pools and
ADD. Select Import an existing pool, then click NEXT as shown in
Figure %s.

   [image]Pool Import

To import a pool, click No, continue with import then NEXT as shown in
Figure %s.

   [image]Importing a Pool

Select the pool from the Pool * drop-down menu and click NEXT to
confirm the options and IMPORT it.

If hardware is not being detected, run **camcontrol devlist** from
Shell. If the disk does not appear in the output, check to see if the
controller driver is supported or if it needs to be loaded using
Tunables.

Before importing an encrypted pool, disks must first be decrypted.
Click Yes, decrypt the disks. This is shown in Figure %s.

   [image]Decrypting Disks Before Importing a Pool

Use the Disks dropdown menu to select the disks to decrypt. Click
Browse to select the encryption key file stored on the client system.
Enter the Passphrase associated with the encryption key, then click
NEXT to continue importing the pool.

Danger:

  The encryption key file and passphrase are required to decrypt the
  pool. If the pool cannot be decrypted, it cannot be re-imported
  after a failed upgrade or lost configuration. This means it is
  **very important** to save a copy of the key and to remember the
  passphrase that was configured for the key. Refer to Managing
  Encrypted Pools for instructions on managing keys.

Select the pool to import and confirm the settings. Click IMPORT to
finish the process.

Note:

  For security reasons, encrypted pool keys are not saved in a
  configuration backup file. When FreeNAS^® has been installed to a
  new device and a saved configuration file restored to it, the keys
  for encrypted disks will not be present, and the system will not
  request them. To correct this, export the encrypted pool with 
  (Configure) ‣ Export/Disconnect, making sure that Destroy data on
  this pool? is **not** set. Then import the pool again. During the
  import, the encryption keys can be entered as described above.


10.2.9. Viewing Pool Scrub Status
---------------------------------

Scrubs and how to set their schedule are described in more detail in
Scrub Tasks.

To view the scrub status of a pool, click the pool name,  (Settings),
then Status. The resulting screen will display the status and
estimated time remaining for a running scrub or the statistics from
the last completed scrub.

A CANCEL button is provided to cancel a scrub in progress. When a
scrub is cancelled, it is abandoned. The next scrub to run starts from
the beginning, not where the cancelled scrub left off.


10.2.10. Adding Datasets
------------------------

An existing pool can be divided into datasets. Permissions,
compression, deduplication, and quotas can be set on a per-dataset
basis, allowing more granular control over access to storage data.
Like a folder or directory, permissions can be set on dataset.
Datasets are also similar to filesystems in that properties such as
quotas and compression can be set, and snapshots created.

Note:

  ZFS provides thick provisioning using quotas and thin provisioning
  using reserved space.

To create a dataset, select an existing pool in Storage ‣ Pools, click
 (Options), then select Add Dataset This will display the screen
shown in Figure %s.

   [image]Creating a ZFS Dataset

Table %s shows the options available when creating a dataset.

Some settings are only available in ADVANCED MODE. To see these
settings, either click the ADVANCED MODE button, or configure the
system to always display advanced settings by enabling the Show
advanced fields by default option in System ‣ Advanced.

After a dataset is created it appears in Storage ‣ Pools. Click 
(Options) on an existing dataset to configure these options:

**Add Dataset:** create a nested dataset, or a dataset within a
dataset.

**Add Zvol:** add a zvol to the dataset. Refer to Adding Zvols for
more information about zvols.

**Edit Options:** edit the pool properties described in Table %s. Note
that Dataset Name and Case Sensitivity are read-only as they cannot be
edited after dataset creation.

**Edit Permissions:** refer to Setting Permissions for more
information about permissions.

Danger:

  Removing a dataset is a permanent action and results in data loss!

**Edit ACL:** see ACL Management for details about modifying an Access
Control List (ACL).

**Delete Dataset:** removes the dataset, snapshots of that dataset,
and any objects stored within the dataset. To remove the dataset, set
Confirm, click DELETE DATASET, verify that the correct dataset to be
deleted has been chosen by entering the dataset name, and click
DELETE. When the dataset has active shares or is still being used by
other parts of the system, the dialog shows what is still using it and
allows forcing the deletion anyway. **Caution**: forcing the deletion
of an in-use dataset can cause data loss or other problems.

**Promote Dataset:** only appears on clones. When a clone is promoted,
the origin filesystem becomes a clone of the clone making it possible
to destroy the filesystem that the clone was created from. Otherwise,
a clone cannot be deleted while the origin filesystem exists.

**Create Snapshot:** create a one-time snapshot. A dialog opens to
name the snapshot. Options to include child datasets in the snapshot
and synchronize with VMware can also be shown. To schedule snapshot
creation, use Periodic Snapshot Tasks.


10.2.10.1. Deduplication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deduplication is the process of ZFS transparently reusing a single
copy of duplicated data to save space. Depending on the amount of
duplicate data, deduplicaton can improve storage capacity, as less
data is written and stored. However, deduplication is RAM intensive. A
general rule of thumb is 5 GiB of RAM per terabyte of deduplicated
storage. **In most cases, compression provides storage gains
comparable to deduplication with less impact on performance.**

In FreeNAS^®, deduplication can be enabled during dataset creation. Be
forewarned that **there is no way to undedup the data within a dataset
once deduplication is enabled**, as disabling deduplication has **NO
EFFECT** on existing data. The more data written to a deduplicated
dataset, the more RAM it requires. When the system starts storing the
DDTs (dedup tables) on disk because they no longer fit into RAM,
performance craters. Further, importing an unclean pool can require
between 3-5 GiB of RAM per terabyte of deduped data, and if the system
does not have the needed RAM, it will panic. The only solution is to
add more RAM or recreate the pool. **Think carefully before enabling
dedup!** This article provides a good description of the value versus
cost considerations for deduplication.

**Unless a lot of RAM and a lot of duplicate data is available, do not
change the default deduplication setting of "Off".** For performance
reasons, consider using compression rather than turning this option
on.

If deduplication is changed to *On*, duplicate data blocks are removed
synchronously. The result is that only unique data is stored and
common components are shared among files. If deduplication is changed
to *Verify*, ZFS will do a byte-to-byte comparison when two blocks
have the same signature to make sure that the block contents are
identical. Since hash collisions are extremely rare, *Verify* is
usually not worth the performance hit.

Note:

  After deduplication is enabled, the only way to disable it is to use
  the "zfs set dedup=off *dataset_name*" command from Shell. However,
  any data that has already been deduplicated will not be un-
  deduplicated. Only newly stored data after the property change will
  not be deduplicated. The only way to remove existing deduplicated
  data is to copy all of the data off of the dataset, set the property
  to off, then copy the data back in again. Alternately, create a new
  dataset with ZFS Deduplication left at *Off*, copy the data to the
  new dataset, and destroy the original dataset.

Tip:

  Deduplication is often considered when using a group of very similar
  virtual machine images. However, other features of ZFS can provide
  dedup-like functionality more efficiently. For example, create a
  dataset for a standard VM, then clone a snapshot of that dataset for
  other VMs. Only the difference between each created VM and the main
  dataset are saved, giving the effect of deduplication without the
  overhead.


10.2.10.2. Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When selecting a compression type, balancing performance with the
amount of disk space saved by compression is recommended. Compression
is transparent to the client and applications as ZFS automatically
compresses data as it is written to a compressed dataset or zvol and
automatically decompresses that data as it is read. These compression
algorithms are supported:

* **LZ4:** default and recommended compression method as it allows
  compressed datasets to operate at near real-time speed. This
  algorithm only compresses files that will benefit from compression.

* **GZIP:** levels 1, 6, and 9 where *gzip fastest* (level 1) gives
  the least compression and *gzip maximum* (level 9) provides the best
  compression but is discouraged due to its performance impact.

* **ZLE:** fast but simple algorithm which eliminates runs of zeroes.

If *OFF* is selected as the Compression level when creating a dataset
or zvol, compression will not be used on that dataset/zvol. This is
not recommended as using *LZ4* has a negligible performance impact and
allows for more storage capacity.


10.2.11. Adding Zvols
---------------------

A zvol is a feature of ZFS that creates a raw block device over ZFS.
The zvol can be used as an iSCSI device extent.

To create a zvol, select an existing ZFS pool or dataset, click 
(Options), then Add Zvol to open the screen shown in Figure %s.

10.2.12. Setting Permissions
----------------------------

Setting permissions is an important aspect of managing data access.
The web interface is meant to set the **initial** permissions for a
pool or dataset to make it available as a share. When a share is made
available, the client operating system and ACL manager is used to
fine-tune the permissions of the files and directories that are
created by the client.

Sharing contains configuration examples for several types of
permission scenarios. This section provides an overview of the options
available for configuring the initial set of permissions.

Note:

  For users and groups to be available, they must either be first
  created using the instructions in Accounts or imported from a
  directory service using the instructions in Directory Services. The
  drop-down menus described in this section are automatically
  truncated to 50 entries for performance reasons. To find an unlisted
  entry, begin typing the desired user or group name for the drop-down
  menu to show matching results.

To set the permissions on a dataset, select it in Storage ‣ Pools,
click  (Options), then Edit Permissions. Table %s describes the
options in this screen.

+---------------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


10.2.13. ACL Management
-----------------------

An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of account permissions
associated with a dataset and applied to directories or files within
that dataset. These permissions control the actions users can perform
on the dataset contents. ACLs are typically used to manage user
interactions with shared datasets. Datasets with an ACL have "(ACL)"
appended to their name in the directory browser.

The ACL for a new file or directory is typically determined by the
parent directory ACL. An exception is when there are no *File Inherit*
or *Directory Inherit* flags in the parent ACL "owner@", "group@", or
"everyone@" entries. These non-inheriting entries are appended to the
ACL of the newly created file or directory based on the Samba create
and directory masks or the umask value.

By default, a file ACL is preserved when it is moved or renamed within
the same dataset. The SMB winmsa module can override this behavior to
force an ACL to be recalculated whenever the file moves, even within
the same dataset.

Datasets optimized for SMB sharing can restrict ACL changes. See ACL
Mode in the Dataset Options table.

ACLs are modified by adding or removing Access Control Entries (ACEs)
in Storage ‣ Pools. Find the desired dataset, click  (Options), and
select Edit ACL. The ACL Manager opens. The ACL manager must be used
to modify permissions on a dataset with an ACL.

   [image]ACL Manager

The ACL Manager options are split into the File Information, Access
Control List, and Advanced sections. Table %s sorts these options by
their section.

Additional ACEs are created by clicking ADD ACL ITEM and configuring
the added fields. One ACE is required in the ACL.

See setfacl(1), nfs4_acl(5), and NFS Version 4 ACLs memo for more
details about Access Control Lists, permissions, and inheritance
flags. The following lists show each permission or flag that can be
applied to an ACE with a brief description.

An ACE can have a variety of basic or advanced permissions:

**Basic Permissions**

* *Read* : view file or directory contents, attributes, named
  attributes, and ACL. Includes the *Traverse* permission.

* *Modify* : adjust file or directory contents, attributes, and named
  attributes. Create new files or subdirectories. Includes the
  *Traverse* permission. Changing the ACL contents or owner is not
  allowed.

* *Traverse* : Execute a file or move through a directory. Directory
  contents are restricted from view unless the *Read* permission is
  also applied. To traverse and view files in a directory, but not be
  able to open individual files, set the *Traverse* and *Read*
  permissions, then add the advanced *Directory Inherit* flag.

* *Full Control* : Apply all permissions.

**Advanced Permissions**

* *Read Data* : View file contents or list directory contents.

* *Write Data* : Create new files or modify any part of a file.

* *Append Data* : Add new data to the end of a file.

* *Read Named Attributes* : view the named attributes directory.

* *Write Named Attributes* : create a named attribute directory. Must
  be paired with the *Read Named Attributes* permission.

* *Execute* : Execute a file, move through, or search a directory.

* *Delete Children* : delete files or subdirectories from inside a
  directory.

* *Read Attributes* : view file or directory non-ACL attributes.

* *Write Attributes* : change file or directory non-ACL attributes.

* *Delete* : remove the file or directory.

* *Read ACL* : view the ACL.

* *Write ACL* : change the ACL and the ACL mode.

* *Write Owner* : change the user and group owners of the file or
  directory.

* *Synchronize* : synchronous file read/write with the server. This
  permission does not apply to FreeBSD clients.

Basic inheritance flags only enable or disable ACE inheritance.
Advanced flags offer finer control for applying an ACE to new files or
directories.

* *File Inherit* : The ACE is inherited with subdirectories and files.
  It applies to new files.

* *Directory Inherit* : new subdirectories inherit the full ACE.

* *No Propagate Inherit* : The ACE can only be inherited once.

* *Inherit Only* : Remove the ACE from permission checks but allow it
  to be inherited by new files or subdirectories. *Inherit Only* is
  removed from these new objects.

* *Inherited* : set when the ACE has been inherited from another
  dataset.


10.3. Snapshots
===============

To view and manage the listing of created snapshots, use Storage ‣
Snapshots. An example is shown in Figure %s.

Note:

  If snapshots do not appear, check that the current time configured
  in Periodic Snapshot Tasks does not conflict with the Begin, End,
  and Interval settings. If the snapshot was attempted but failed, an
  entry is added to "/var/log/messages". This log file can be viewed
  in Shell.

   [image]Viewing Available Snapshots

Each entry in the list includes the name of the dataset and snapshot.
Click  (Expand) to view these options:

**DATE CREATED** shows the exact time and date of the snapshot
creation.

**USED** is the amount of space consumed by this dataset and all of
its descendants. This value is checked against the dataset quota and
reservation. The space used does not include the dataset reservation,
but does take into account the reservations of any descendent
datasets. The amount of space that a dataset consumes from its parent,
as well as the amount of space freed if this dataset is recursively
deleted, is the greater of its space used and its reservation. When a
snapshot is created, the space is initially shared between the
snapshot and the filesystem, and possibly with previous snapshots. As
the filesystem changes, space that was previously shared becomes
unique to the snapshot, and is counted in the used space of the
snapshot. Deleting a snapshot can increase the amount of space unique
to, and used by, other snapshots. The amount of space used, available,
or referenced does not take into account pending changes. While
pending changes are generally accounted for within a few seconds, disk
changes do not necessarily guarantee that the space usage information
is updated immediately.

Tip:

  Space used by individual snapshots can be seen by running "zfs list
  -t snapshot" from Shell.

**REFERENCED** indicates the amount of data accessible by this
dataset, which may or may not be shared with other datasets in the
pool. When a snapshot or clone is created, it initially references the
same amount of space as the filesystem or snapshot it was created
from, since its contents are identical.

**DELETE** shows a confirmation dialog. Child clones must be deleted
before their parent snapshot can be deleted. While creating a snapshot
is instantaneous, deleting a snapshot can be I/O intensive and can
take a long time, especially when deduplication is enabled. In order
to delete a block in a snapshot, ZFS has to walk all the allocated
blocks to see if that block is used anywhere else; if it is not, it
can be freed.

**CLONE TO NEW DATASET** prompts for the name of the new dataset
created from the cloned snapshot. A default name is provided based on
the name of the original snapshot. Click the SAVE button to finish
cloning the snapshot.

A clone is a writable copy of the snapshot. Since a clone is actually
a dataset which can be mounted, it appears in the Pools screen rather
than the Snapshots screen. By default, "-clone" is added to the name
of a snapshot when a clone is created.

**Rollback:** Clicking  (Options) ‣ Rollback asks for confirmation
before rolling back to the chosen snapshot state. Clicking Yes causes
all files in the dataset to revert to the state they were in when the
snapshot was created.

Note:

  Rollback is a potentially dangerous operation and causes any
  configured replication tasks to fail as the replication system uses
  the existing snapshot when doing an incremental backup. To restore
  the data within a snapshot, the recommended steps are:

  1. Clone the desired snapshot.

  2. Share the clone with the share type or service running on the
     FreeNAS^® system.

  3. After users have recovered the needed data, delete the clone in
     the Active Pools tab.

  This approach does not destroy any on-disk data and has no impact on
  replication.

A range of snapshots can be deleted. Set the left column checkboxes
for each snapshot and click the Delete icon above the table. Be
careful when deleting multiple snapshots.

Periodic snapshots can be configured to appear as shadow copies in
newer versions of Windows Explorer, as described in Configuring Shadow
Copies. Users can access the files in the shadow copy using Explorer
without requiring any interaction with the FreeNAS^® web interface.

To quickly search through the snapshots list by name, type a matching
criteria into the Filter Snapshots text area. The listing will change
to only display the snapshot names that match the filter text.

Warning:

  A snapshot and any files it contains will not be accessible or
  searchable if the mount path of the snapshot is longer than 88
  characters. The data  within the snapshot will be safe, and the
  snapshot will become accessible again when the mount path is
  shortened. For details of this limitation, and how to shorten a long
  mount path, see Path and Name Lengths.


10.3.1. Browsing a Snapshot Collection
--------------------------------------

All snapshots for a dataset are accessible as an ordinary hierarchical
filesystem, which can be reached from a hidden ".zfs" file located at
the root of every dataset. A user with permission to access that file
can view and explore all snapshots for a dataset like any other files
- from the **CLI** or via File Sharing services such as Samba, NFS and
FTP. This is an advanced capability which requires some command line
actions to achieve. In summary, the main changes to settings that are
required are:

* Snapshot visibility must be manually enabled in the ZFS properties
  of the dataset.

* In Samba auxillary settings, the **veto files** command must be
  modified  to not hide the ".zfs" file, and the setting
  **zfsacl:expose_snapdir=true** must be added.

The effect will be that any user who can access the dataset contents
will be able to view the list of snapshots by navigating to the ".zfs"
directory of the dataset. They will also be able to browse and search
any files they have permission to access throughout the entire
snapshot collection of the dataset.

A user's ability to view files within a snapshot will be limited by
any permissions or ACLs set on the files when the snapshot was taken.
Snapshots are fixed as "read-only", so this access does not permit the
user to change any files in the snapshots, or to modify or delete any
snapshot, even if they had write permission at the time when the
snapshot was taken.

Note:

  ZFS has a **zfs diff** command which can list the files that have
  changed between any two snapshot versions within a dataset, or
  between any snapshot and the current data.


10.3.2. Creating a Single Snapshot
----------------------------------

To create a snapshot separately from a periodic snapshot schedule, go
to Storage ‣ Snapshots and click ADD.

   [image]Single Snapshot Options

Select an existing ZFS pool, dataset, or zvol to snapshot. To include
child datasets with the snapshot, set Recursive.

The snapshot can have a custom Name or be automatically named by a
Naming Schema. Using a Naming Schema allows the snapshot to be
included in Replication Tasks. The Naming Schema drop-down is
populated with previously created schemas from Periodic Snapshot
Tasks.


10.4. VMware-Snapshots
======================

Storage ‣ VMware-Snapshots is used to coordinate ZFS snapshots when
using FreeNAS^® as a VMware datastore. When a ZFS snapshot is created,
FreeNAS^® automatically snapshots any running VMware virtual machines
before taking a scheduled or manual ZFS snapshot of the dataset or
zvol backing that VMware datastore. Virtual machines **must be powered
on** for FreeNAS^® snapshots to be copied to VMware. The temporary
VMware snapshots are then deleted on the VMware side but still exist
in the ZFS snapshot and can be used as stable resurrection points in
that snapshot. These coordinated snapshots are listed in Snapshots.

Figure %s shows the menu for adding a VMware snapshot and Table %s
summarizes the available options.

10.5. Disks
===========

To view all of the disks recognized by the FreeNAS^® system, use
Storage ‣ Disks. As seen in the example in Figure %s, each disk entry
displays its device name, serial number, size, advanced power
management settings, acoustic level settings, and whether S.M.A.R.T.
tests are enabled. The pool associated with the disk is displayed in
the Pool column. *Unused* is displayed if the disk is not being used
in a pool. Click COLUMNS and select additional information to be shown
as columns in the table. Additional information not shown in the table
can be seen by clicking  (Expand).

   [image]Viewing Disks

To edit the options for a disk, click  (Options) on a disk, then Edit
to open the screen shown in Figure %s. Table %s lists the configurable
options.

To bulk edit disks, set the checkbox for each disk in the table then
click  (Edit Disks). The Bulk Edit Disks page displays which disks
are being edited and a short list of configurable options. The Disk
Options table indicates the options available when editing multiple
disks.

Tip:

  If the serial number for a disk is not displayed in this screen, use
  the **smartctl** command from Shell. For example, to determine the
  serial number of disk *ada0*, type **smartctl -a /dev/ada0 | grep
  Serial**.

The Wipe function is used to discard an unused disk.

Warning:

  Ensure all data is backed up and the disk is no longer in use.
  Triple-check that the correct disk is being selected to be wiped, as
  recovering data from a wiped disk is usually impossible. If there is
  any doubt, physically remove the disk, verify that all data is still
  present on the FreeNAS^® system, and wipe the disk in a separate
  computer.

Clicking Wipe offers several choices. *Quick* erases only the
partitioning information on a disk, making it easy to reuse but
without clearing other old data. For more security, *Full with zeros*
overwrites the entire disk with zeros, while *Full with random data*
overwrites the entire disk with random binary data.

Quick wipes take only a few seconds. A *Full with zeros* wipe of a
large disk can take several hours, and a *Full with random data* takes
longer. A progress bar is displayed during the wipe to track status.


10.5.1. Replacing a Failed Disk
-------------------------------

With any form of redundant RAID, failed drives must be replaced as
soon as possible to repair the degraded state of the RAID. Depending
on the hardware capabilities, it might be necessary to reboot to
replace the failed drive. Hardware that supports AHCI does not require
a reboot.

Striping (RAID0) does not provide redundancy. Disk failure in a stripe
results in losing the pool. The pool must be recreated and data stored
in the failed stripe will have to be restored from backups.

Warning:

  Encrypted pools must have a valid passphrase to replace a failed
  disk. Set a passphrase and back up the encryption key using the pool
  Encryption Operations **before** attempting to replace the failed
  drive.

Before physically removing the failed device, go to Storage ‣ Pools.
Select the pool name then click  (Settings). Select Status and locate
the failed disk. Then perform these steps:

1. Click  (Options) on the disk entry, then Offline to change the
   disk status to OFFLINE. This step removes the device from the pool
   and prevents swap issues. *Warning:* encrypted disks that are set
   OFFLINE cannot be set back ONLINE. If the hardware supports hot-
   pluggable disks, click the disk Offline button and pull the disk,
   then skip to step 3. If there is no Offline but only Replace, the
   disk is already offlined and this step can be skipped.

   Note:

     If the process of changing the disk status to OFFLINE fails with
     a "disk offline failed - no valid replicas" message, the pool
     must be scrubbed first with the Scrub Pool button in Storage ‣
     Pools. After the scrub completes, try Offline again before
     proceeding.

2. After the disk is replaced and is showing as OFFLINE, click 
   (Options) on the disk again and then Replace. Select the
   replacement disk from the drop-down menu and click the REPLACE DISK
   button.  After clicking the REPLACE DISK button, the pool begins
   resilvering.

   Encrypted pools require entering the encryption key passphrase when
   choosing a replacement disk. Clicking REPLACE DISK begins the
   process to reformat the replacement, apply the current pool
   encryption algorithm, and resilver the pool. The current pool
   encryption key and passphrase remains valid, but any pool recovery
   key file is invalidated by the replacement process. To maximize
   pool security, it is recommended to reset pool encryption.

3. After the drive replacement process is complete, re-add the
   replaced disk in the S.M.A.R.T. Tests screen.

To refresh the screen with updated entries, click REFRESH. If any
problems occur during a disk replacement process, one of the disks can
be detached. To detach a disk in the replacement process, find the
disk to be replaced and click  (Options) ‣ Detach.

Figure %s shows an example of going to Storage ‣ Pools ‣ Status and
replacing a disk in an active pool.

   [image]Replacing a Failed Disk

After the resilver is complete, the pool status shows a Completed
resilver status and indicates any errors. Figure %s indicates that the
disk replacement was successful in this example.

Note:

  A disk that is failing but has not completely failed can be replaced
  in place, without first removing it. Whether this is a good idea
  depends on the overall condition of the failing disk. A disk with a
  few newly-bad blocks that is otherwise functional can be left in
  place during the replacement to provide data redundancy. A drive
  that is experiencing continuous errors can actually slow down the
  replacement. In extreme cases, a disk with serious problems might
  spend so much time retrying failures that it could prevent the
  replacement resilvering from completing before another drive fails.

   [image]Disk Replacement is Complete


10.5.1.1. Removing a Log or Cache Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added log or cache devices appear in Storage ‣ Pools ‣ Pool Status.
Clicking the device enables the Replace and Remove buttons.

Log and cache devices can be safely removed or replaced with these
buttons. Both types of devices improve performance, and throughput can
be impacted by their removal.


10.5.2. Replacing Disks to Grow a Pool
--------------------------------------

The recommended method for expanding the size of a ZFS pool is to pre-
plan the number of disks in a vdev and to stripe additional vdevs from
Pools as additional capacity is needed.

But adding vdevs is not an option if there are not enough unused disk
ports. If there is at least one unused disk port or drive bay, a
single disk at a time can be replaced with a larger disk, waiting for
the resilvering process to include the new disk into the pool,
removing the old disk, then repeating with another disk until all of
the original disks have been replaced. At that point, the pool
capacity automatically increases to include the new space.

One advantage of this method is that disk redundancy is present during
the process.

Note:

  A pool that is configured as a stripe can only be increased by
  following the steps in Extending a Pool.

1. Connect the new, larger disk to the unused disk port or drive bay.

2. Go to Storage ‣ Pools.

3. Select the pool and click  (Settings) ‣ Status.

4. Select one of the old, smaller disks in the pool. Click  (Options)
   ‣ Replace. Choose the new disk as the replacement.

The status of the resilver process is shown on the screen, or can be
viewed with **zpool status**. When the new disk has resilvered, the
old one is automatically offlined. It can then be removed from the
system, and that port or bay used to hold the next new disk.

If a unused disk port or bay is not available, a drive can be replaced
with a larger one as shown in Replacing a Failed Disk. This process is
slow and places the system in a degraded state. Since a failure at
this point could be disastrous, **do not attempt this method unless
the system has a reliable backup.** Replace one drive at a time and
wait for the resilver process to complete on the replaced drive before
replacing the next drive. After all the drives are replaced and the
final resilver completes, the added space appears in the pool.


10.6. Importing a Disk
======================

The Storage ‣ Import Disk screen, shown in Figure %s, is used to
import disks that are formatted with UFS (BSD Unix), FAT(MSDOS) or
NTFS (Windows), or EXT2 (Linux) filesystems. This is a designed to be
used as a one-time import, copying the data from that disk into a
dataset on the FreeNAS^® system. Only one disk can be imported at a
time.

Note:

  Imports of EXT3 or EXT4 filesystems are possible in some cases,
  although neither is fully supported. EXT3 journaling is not
  supported, so those filesystems must have an external *fsck*
  utility, like the one provided by E2fsprogs utilities, run on them
  before import. EXT4 filesystems with extended attributes or inodes
  greater than 128 bytes are not supported. EXT4 filesystems with EXT3
  journaling must have an *fsck* run on them before import, as
  described above.

   [image]Importing a Disk

Use the drop-down menu to select the disk to import, confirm the
detected filesystem is correct, and browse to the ZFS dataset that
will hold the copied data. If the MSDOSFS filesystem is selected, an
additional MSDOSFS locale drop-down menu is displayed. Use this menu
to select the locale if non-ASCII characters are present on the disk.

After clicking SAVE, the disk is mounted and its contents are copied
to the specified dataset. The disk is unmounted after the copy
operation completes.

After importing a disk, a dialog allows viewing or downloading the
disk import log.


10.7. Multipaths
================

This option is only displayed on systems that contain multipath-
capable hardware like a chassis equipped with a dual SAS expander
backplane or an external JBOD that is wired for multipath.

FreeNAS^® uses gmultipath(8) to provide multipath I/O support on
systems containing multipath-capable hardware.

Multipath hardware adds fault tolerance to a NAS as the data is still
available even if one disk I/O path has a failure.

FreeNAS^® automatically detects active/active and active/passive
multipath-capable hardware. Discovered multipath-capable devices are
placed in multipath units with the parent devices hidden. The
configuration is displayed in Storage ‣ Multipaths.


11. Overprovisioning
********************

Overprovisioning SSDs can be done using the **disk_resize** command in
the Shell. This can be useful for many different scenarios. Perhaps
the most useful benefit of overprovisioning is that it can extend the
life of an SSD greatly. Overprovisioning an SSD distributes the total
number of writes and erases across more flash blocks on the drive.
Read more about overprovisioning SSDs here.

The command to overprovision an SSD is "disk_resize *device* *size*",
where *device* is the device name of the SSD and *size* is the desired
size of the provision in *GB* or *TB*. Here is an example of the
command: "disk_resize ada5 16GB". When no size is specified, it
reverts the provision back the full size of the device.

   [image]disk_resize Command

Note:

  Some SATA devices may be limited to one resize per power cycle. Some
  BIOS may block resize during boot and require a live power cycle.
