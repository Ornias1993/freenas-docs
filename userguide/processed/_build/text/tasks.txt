8. Tasks
********

The Tasks section of the web interface is used to configure repetitive
tasks:

* Cron Jobs schedules a command or script to automatically execute at
  a specified time

* Init/Shutdown Scripts configures a command or script to
  automatically execute during system startup or shutdown

* Rsync Tasks schedules data synchronization to another system

* S.M.A.R.T. Tests schedules disk tests

* Periodic Snapshot Tasks schedules automatic creation of filesystem
  snapshots

* Replication Tasks automate the replication of snapshots to a remote
  system

* Resilver Priority controls the priority of resilvers

* Scrub Tasks schedules scrubs as part of ongoing disk maintenance

* Cloud Sync Tasks schedules data synchronization to cloud providers

Each of these tasks is described in more detail in this section.

Note:

  By default, Scrub Tasks are run once a month by an automatically-
  created task. S.M.A.R.T. Tests and Periodic Snapshot Tasks must be
  set up manually.


8.1. Cron Jobs
==============

cron(8) is a daemon that runs a command or script on a regular
schedule as a specified user.

Go to Tasks ‣ Cron Jobs and click ADD to create a cron job.

   [image]Cron Job Settings

Table %s lists the configurable options for a cron job.

Cron jobs are shown in Tasks ‣ Cron Jobs. This table displays the
user, command, description, schedule, and whether the job is enabled.
This table is adjustable by setting the different column checkboxes
above it. Set Toggle to display all options in the table. Click 
(Options) for to show the Run Now, Edit, and Delete options.

Note:

  "%" symbols are automatically escaped and do not need to be prefixed
  with backslashes. For example, use "date '+%Y-%m-%d'" in a cron job
  to generate a filename based on the date.


8.2. Init/Shutdown Scripts
==========================

FreeNAS^® provides the ability to schedule commands or scripts to run
at system startup or shutdown.

Go to Tasks ‣ Init/Shutdown Scripts and click ADD.

|               |                  | before FreeNAS^® services start  * *Shutdown*: during the system power off process.            |
+---------------+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Enabled       | checkbox         | Enable this task. Unset to disable the task without deleting it.                               |
+---------------+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Timeout       | integer          | Automatically stop the script or command after the specified number of seconds.                |
+---------------+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Scheduled commands must be in the default path. The full path to the
command can also be included in the entry. The path can be tested with
**which {commandname}** in the Shell. When available, the path to the
command is shown:

   [root@freenas ~]# which ls
   /bin/ls

When scheduling a script, test the script first to verify it is
executable and achieves the desired results.

Note:

  Init/shutdown scripts are run with **sh**.

Init/Shutdown tasks are shown in Tasks ‣ Init/Shutdown Scripts. Click
 (Options) for a task to Edit or Delete that task.


8.3. Rsync Tasks
================

Rsync is a utility that copies specified data from one system to
another over a network. Once the initial data is copied, rsync reduces
the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the
differences between the source and destination files. Rsync is used
for backups, mirroring data on multiple systems, or for copying files
between systems.

Rsync is most effective when only a relatively small amount of the
data has changed. There are also some limitations when using rsync
with Windows files. For large amounts of data, data that has many
changes from the previous copy, or Windows files, Replication Tasks
are often the faster and better solution.

Rsync is single-threaded and gains little from multiple processor
cores. To see whether rsync is currently running, use "pgrep rsync"
from the Shell.

Both ends of an rsync connection must be configured:

* **the rsync server:** this system pulls (receives) the data. This
  system is referred to as *PULL* in the configuration examples.

* **the rsync client:** this system pushes (sends) the data. This
  system is referred to as *PUSH* in the configuration examples.

FreeNAS^® can be configured as either an *rsync client* or an *rsync
server*. The opposite end of the connection can be another FreeNAS^®
system or any other system running rsync. In FreeNAS^® terminology, an
*rsync task* defines which data is synchronized between the two
systems. To synchronize data between two FreeNAS^® systems, create the
*rsync task* on the *rsync client*.

FreeNAS^® supports two modes of rsync operation:

* **Module:** exports a directory tree, and the configured settings of
  the tree as a symbolic name over an unencrypted connection. This
  mode requires that at least one module be defined on the rsync
  server. It can be defined in the FreeNAS^® web interface under
  Services ‣ Rsync Configure ‣ Rsync Module. In other operating
  systems, the module is defined in rsyncd.conf(5).

* **SSH:** synchronizes over an encrypted connection. Requires the
  configuration of SSH user and host public keys.

This section summarizes the options when creating an rsync task. It
then provides a configuration example between two FreeNAS^® systems
for each mode of rsync operation.

Note:

  If there is a firewall between the two systems or if the other
  system has a built-in firewall, make sure that TCP port 873 is
  allowed.

Figure %s shows the screen that appears after navigating to Tasks ‣
Rsync Tasks and clicking ADD. Table %s summarizes the configuration
options available when creating an rsync task.

If the rysnc server requires password authentication, enter "--
password-file=*/PATHTO/FILENAME*" in the Extra options field,
replacing "/PATHTO/FILENAME" with the appropriate path to the file
containing the password.

Created rsync tasks are listed in Rsync Tasks. Click  (Options) for
an entry to display buttons for Edit, Delete, or Run Now.

The Status column shows the status of the rsync task. To view the
detailed rsync logs for a task, click the Status entry when the task
is running or finished.

Rsync tasks also generate an Alert on task completion. The alert shows
if the task succeeded or failed.


8.3.1. Rsync Module Mode
------------------------

This configuration example configures rsync module mode between the
two following FreeNAS^® systems:

* *192.168.2.2* has existing data in "/mnt/local/images". It will be
  the rsync client, meaning that an rsync task needs to be defined. It
  will be referred to as *PUSH.*

* *192.168.2.6* has an existing pool named "/mnt/remote". It will be
  the rsync server, meaning that it will receive the contents of
  "/mnt/local/images". An rsync module needs to be defined on this
  system and the rsyncd service needs to be started. It will be
  referred to as *PULL.*

On *PUSH*, an rsync task is defined in Tasks ‣ Rsync Tasks, ADD. In
this example:

* the Path points to "/usr/local/images", the directory to be copied

* the Remote Host points to *192.168.2.6*, the IP address of the rsync
  server

* the Rsync Mode is *Module*

* the Remote Module Name is *backups*; this will need to be defined on
  the rsync server

* the Direction is *Push*

* the rsync is scheduled to occur every 15 minutes

* the User is set to *root* so it has permission to write anywhere

* the Preserve Permissions option is enabled so that the original
  permissions are not overwritten by the *root* user

On *PULL*, an rsync module is defined in Services ‣ Rsync Configure ‣
Rsync Module, ADD. In this example:

* the Module Name is *backups*; this needs to match the setting on the
  rsync client

* the Path is "/mnt/remote"; a directory called "images" will be
  created to hold the contents of "/usr/local/images"

* the User is set to *root* so it has permission to write anywhere

Descriptions of the configurable options can be found in Rsync
Modules.

* Hosts allow is set to *192.168.2.2*, the IP address of the rsync
  client

To finish the configuration, start the rsync service on *PULL* in
Services. If the rsync is successful, the contents of
"/mnt/local/images/" will be mirrored to "/mnt/remote/images/".


8.3.2. Rsync over SSH Mode
--------------------------

SSH replication mode does not require the creation of an rsync module
or for the rsync service to be running on the rsync server. It does
require SSH to be configured before creating the rsync task:

* a public/private key pair for the rsync user account (typically
  *root*) must be generated on *PUSH* and the public key copied to the
  same user account on *PULL*

* to mitigate the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, the public host
  key of *PULL* must be copied to *PUSH*

* the SSH service must be running on *PULL*

To create the public/private key pair for the rsync user account, open
Shell on *PUSH* and run **ssh-keygen**. This example generates an RSA
type public/private key pair for the *root* user. When creating the
key pair, do not enter the passphrase as the key is meant to be used
for an automated task.

FreeNAS^® supports RSA keys for SSH. When creating the key, use "-t
rsa" to specify this type of key. Refer to Key-based Authentication
for more information.

Note:

  If a different user account is used for the rsync task, use the **su
  -** command after mounting the filesystem but before generating the
  key. For example, if the rsync task is configured to use the *user1*
  user account, use this command to become that user:

     su - user1

Next, view and copy the contents of the generated public key:

   more .ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC1lBEXRgw1W8y8k+lXPlVR3xsmVSjtsoyIzV/PlQPo

   DmNfwrRSxLjDvUzfywnjFHlKk/+TQIT1gg1QQaj21PJD9pnDVF0AiJrWyWnR root@freenas.local

Go to *PULL* and paste (or append) the copied key into the SSH Public
Key field of Accounts ‣ Users ‣ root ‣  (Options) ‣ Edit, or the
username of the specified rsync user account. The paste for the above
example is shown in Figure %s. When pasting the key, ensure that it is
pasted as one long line and, if necessary, remove any extra spaces
representing line breaks.

   [image]Pasting the User SSH Public Key

While on *PULL*, verify that the SSH service is running in Services
and start it if it is not.

Next, copy the host key of *PULL* using Shell on *PUSH*. The command
copies the RSA host key of the *PULL* server used in our previous
example. Be sure to include the double bracket *>>* to prevent
overwriting any existing entries in the "known_hosts" file:

   ssh-keyscan -t rsa 192.168.2.6 >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts

Note:

  If *PUSH* is a Linux system, use this command to copy the RSA key to
  the Linux system:

     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@192.168.2.6 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

The rsync task can now be created on *PUSH*. To configure rsync SSH
mode using the systems in our previous example, the configuration is:

* the Path points to "/mnt/local/images", the directory to be copied

* the Remote Host points to *192.168.2.6*, the IP address of the rsync
  server

* the Rsync Mode is *SSH*

* the rsync is scheduled to occur every 15 minutes

* the User is set to *root* so it has permission to write anywhere;
  the public key for this user must be generated on *PUSH* and copied
  to *PULL*

* the Preserve Permissions option is enabled so that the original
  permissions are not overwritten by the *root* user

Save the rsync task and the rsync will automatically occur according
to the schedule. In this example, the contents of "/mnt/local/images/"
will automatically appear in "/mnt/remote/images/" after 15 minutes.
If the content does not appear, use Shell on *PULL* to read
"/var/log/messages". If the message indicates a *n* (newline
character) in the key, remove the space in the pasted key--it will be
after the character that appears just before the *n* in the error
message.


8.4. S.M.A.R.T. Tests
=====================

S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) is a
monitoring system for computer hard disk drives to detect and report
on various indicators of reliability. Replace the drive when a failure
is anticipated by S.M.A.R.T. Most modern ATA, IDE, and SCSI-3 hard
drives support S.M.A.R.T. -- refer to the drive documentation for
confirmation.

Click Tasks ‣ S.M.A.R.T. Tests and ADD to add a new scheduled
S.M.A.R.T. test. Figure %s shows the configuration screen that
appears. Tests are listed under S.M.A.R.T. Tests. After creating
tests, check the configuration in Services ‣ S.M.A.R.T., then click
the power button for the S.M.A.R.T. service in Services to activate
the service. The S.M.A.R.T. service will not start if there are no
pools.

Note:

  To prevent problems, do not enable the S.M.A.R.T. service if the
  disks are controlled by a RAID controller. It is the job of the
  controller to monitor S.M.A.R.T. and mark drives as Predictive
  Failure when they trip.

   [image]Adding a S.M.A.R.T. Test

Table %s summarizes the configurable options when creating a
S.M.A.R.T. test.

An example configuration is to schedule a Short Self-Test once a week
and a Long Self-Test once a month. These tests do not have a
performance impact, as the disks prioritize normal I/O over the tests.
If a disk fails a test, even if the overall status is *Passed*,
consider replacing that disk.

Warning:

  Some S.M.A.R.T. tests cause heavy disk activity and can drastically
  reduce disk performance. Do not schedule S.M.A.R.T. tests to run at
  the same time as scrub or resilver operations or during other
  periods of intense disk activity.

Which tests will run and when can be verified by typing **smartd -q
showtests** within Shell.

The results of a test can be checked from Shell by specifying the name
of the drive. For example, to see the results for disk *ada0*, type:

   smartctl -l selftest /dev/ada0


8.5. Periodic Snapshot Tasks
============================

A periodic snapshot task allows scheduling the creation of read-only
versions of pools and datasets at a given point in time. Snapshots can
be created quickly and, if little data changes, new snapshots take up
very little space. For example, a snapshot where no files have changed
takes 0 MB of storage, but as changes are made to files, the snapshot
size changes to reflect the size of the changes.

Snapshots keep a history of files, providing a way to recover an older
copy or even a deleted file. For this reason, many administrators take
snapshots often, store them for a period of time, and store them on
another system, typically using Replication Tasks. Such a strategy
allows the administrator to roll the system back to a specific point
in time. If there is a catastrophic loss, an off-site snapshot can be
used to restore the system up to the time of the last snapshot.

A pool must exist before a snapshot can be created. Creating a pool is
described in Pools.

View the list of periodic snapshot tasks by going to Tasks ‣ Periodic
Snapshot Tasks. If a periodic snapshot task encounters an error, the
status column will show *ERROR*. Click the status to view the logs of
the task.

To create a periodic snapshot task, navigate to Tasks ‣ Periodic
Snapshot Tasks and click ADD. This opens the screen shown in Figure
%s. Table %s describes the fields in this screen.

Setting Recursive adds child datasets to the snapshot. Creating
separate snapshots for each child dataset is not needed.

The Naming Schema can be manually adjusted to include more
information. For example, after configuring a periodic snapshot task
with a lifetime of two weeks, it could be helpful to define a Naming
Schema that shows the lifetime: "autosnap-%Y-%m-%d.%H-%M-*2w*".

Click SAVE when finished customizing the task. Defined tasks are
listed alphabetically in Tasks ‣ Periodic Snapshot Tasks.

Click  (Options) for a periodic snapshot task to see options to Edit
or Delete the scheduled task.

Deleting a dataset does not delete snapshot tasks for that dataset. To
re-use the snapshot task for a different dataset, Edit the task and
choose the new Dataset. The original dataset is shown in the drop-
down, but cannot be selected.

Deleting the last periodic snapshot task used by a replication task is
not permitted while that replication task remains active. The
replication task must be disabled before the related periodic snapshot
task can be deleted.


8.5.1. Snapshot Autoremoval
---------------------------

The periodic snapshot task autoremoval process (which removes
snapshots after their configured Snapshot Lifetime) is run whenever
any Enabled periodic snapshot task runs.

When the autoremoval process runs, all snapshots on the system are
checked for removal. First, each snapshot is matched with a periodic
snapshot task according to the following criteria:

   * *Dataset/Recursive*: To match a task, a snapshot must be on the
     same Dataset as the task, or on a child dataset if the task is
     marked Recursive.

   * *Naming Schema*: To match a task, a snapshot's name must match
     the Naming Schema defined in that task.

   * *Schedule*: To match a task, the time at which the snapshot was
     created (according to its name and naming schema) must match the
     schedule defined in the task (Schedule the Periodic Snapshot
     Task).

   * *Enabled*: To match a task, the periodic snapshot task must be
     Enabled.

At this point, if the snapshot does not match any periodic snapshot
tasks then it is not considered for autoremoval. However, if it does
match one (or possibly more than one) periodic snapshot task, it is
deleted if its creation time (according to its name and naming schema)
is older than the longest Snapshot Lifetime of any of the tasks it was
matched with.

One notable detail of this process is that there is no saved memory of
which task created which snapshot, or what the parameters of the
periodic snapshot task were at the time a snapshot was created. All
checks for autoremoval are based on the current state of the system.

These details become important when existing periodic snapshot tasks
are edited, disabled, or deleted. When editing a periodic snapshot
task, if the Naming Schema is changed, Recursive is unchecked, or the
task is rescheduled (Schedule the Periodic Snapshot Task), previously
created snapshots may not be automatically removed as expected since
the previously created snapshots may no longer match any periodic
snapshot tasks. Similarly, if a periodic snapshot task is deleted or
marked not Enabled, snapshots previously created by that task will no
longer be automatically removed.

In these cases, the user must manually remove unneeded snapshots that
were previously created by the modified or deleted periodic snapshot
task.


8.6. Replication
================

*Replication* is the process of copying ZFS dataset snapshots from one
storage pool to another. Replications can be configured to copy
snapshots to another pool on the local system or send copies to a
remote system that is in a different physical location.

Replication schedules are typically paired with Periodic Snapshot
Tasks to generate local copies of important data and replicate these
copies to a remote system.

Replications require a source system with dataset snapshots and a
destination that can store the copied data. Remote replications
require a saved SSH Connection on the source system and the
destination system must be configured to allow SSH connections. Local
replications do not use SSH.

Snapshots are organized and sent to the destination according to the
creation date included in the snapshot name. When replicating manually
created snapshots, make sure snapshots are named according to their
actual creation date.

First-time replication tasks can take a long time to complete as the
entire dataset snapshot must be copied to the destination system.
Replicated data is not visible on the receiving system until the
replication task is complete.

Later replications only send incremental snapshot changes to the
destination system. This reduces both the total space required by
replicated data and the network bandwidth required for the replication
to complete.

The replication task asks to destroy destination dataset snapshots
when those snapshots are not related to the replication snapshots.
Verify that the snapshots in the destination dataset are unneeded or
are backed up in a different location! Allowing the replication task
to continue destroys the current snapshots in the destination dataset
and replicates a full copy of the source snapshots.

The target dataset on the destination system is created in *read-only*
mode to protect the data. To mount or browse the data on the
destination system, use a clone of the snapshot. Clones are created in
*read/write* mode, making it possible to browse or mount them. See
Snapshots for more details.

Replications run in parallel as long as they do not conflict with each
other. Completion time depends on the number and size of snapshots and
the bandwidth available between the source and destination computers.

Examples in this section refer to the FreeNAS^® system with the
original datasets for snapshot and replication as *Primary* and the
FreeNAS^® system that is storing replicated snapshots as *Secondary*.


8.6.1. Replication Creation Wizard
----------------------------------

To create a new replication, go to Tasks ‣ Replication Tasks and click
ADD.

   [image]Replication Wizard: What and Where

The wizard allows loading previously saved replication configurations
and simplifies many replication settings. To see all possible
replication creation options, click ADVANCED REPLICATION CREATION.

Using the wizard to create a new replication task begins by defining
what is being replicated and where. Choosing *On a Different System*
for either the Source Location or Destination Location requires an SSH
Connection to the remote system. Open the drop-down menu to choose an
SSH connection or click *Create New* to add a new connection.

Start by selecting the Source datasets to be replicated. To choose a
dataset, click  (Browse) and select the dataset from the expandable
tree. The path of the dataset can also be typed into the field.
Multiple snapshot sources can be chosen using a comma (",") to
separate each selection. Recursive replication will include all
snapshots of any descendant datasets of the chosen Source.

Source datasets on the local system are replicated using existing
snapshots of the chosen datasets. When no snapshots exist, FreeNAS^®
automatically creates snapshots of the chosen datasets before starting
the replication. To manually define which dataset snapshots to
replicate, set Replicate Custom Snapshots and define a snapshot Naming
Schema.

Source datasets on a remote system are replicated by defining a
snapshot Naming Schema. The schema is a pattern of the name and
strftime(3) *%Y*, *%m*, *%d*, *%H*, and *%M* strings that match names
of the snapshots to include in the replication. For example, to
replicate a snapshot named "auto-2019-12-18.05-20" from a remote
source, enter "auto-%Y-%m-%d.%H-%M" as the replication task Naming
Schema.

The number of snapshots that will be replicated is shown. There is
also a Recursive option to include child datasets with the selected
datasets.

Now choose the Destination to receive the replicated snapshots. To
choose a destination path, click  (Browse) and select the dataset
from the expandable tree or type a path to the location in the field.
Only a single Destination path can be defined.

Using an SSH connection for replication adds the SSH Transfer Security
option. This sets the data transfer security level. The connection is
authenticated with SSH. Data can be encrypted during transfer for
security or left unencrypted to maximize transfer speed. **WARNING:**
Encryption is recommended, but can be disabled for increased speed on
secure networks.

A suggested replication Task Name is shown. This can be changed to
give a more meaningful name to the task. When the source and
destination have been set, click NEXT to choose when the replication
will run.

   [image]Replication Wizard: When

The replication task can be configured to run on a schedule or left
unscheduled and manually activated. Choosing *Run On a Schedule* adds
the Scheduling drop-down to choose from preset schedules or define a
*Custom* replication schedule. Choosing *Run Once* removes all
scheduling options.

Destination Snapshot Lifetime determines when replicated snapshots are
deleted from the destination system:

   * *Same as Source*: duplicate the configured *Snapshot Lifetime*
     value from the source dataset periodic snapshot task.

   * *Never Delete*: never delete snapshots from the destination
     system.

   * *Custom*: define how long a snapshot remains on the destination
     system. Enter a number and choose a measure of time from the
     drop-down menus.

Clicking START REPLICATION saves the replication configuration and
activates the schedule. When the replication configuration includes a
source dataset on the local system and has a schedule, a periodic
snapshot task of that dataset is also created.

Tasks set to *Run Once* will start immediately. If a one-time
replication has no valid local system source dataset snapshots,
FreeNAS^® will snapshot the source datasets and immediately replicate
those snapshots to the destination dataset.

All replication tasks are displayed in Tasks ‣ Replication Tasks. The
task settings that are shown by default can be adjusted by opening the
COLUMNS drop-down. To see more details about the last time the
replication task ran, click the entry under the State column. Tasks
can also be expanded by clicking  (Expand) for that task. Expanded
tasks show all replication settings and have  RUN NOW,  EDIT, and 
DELETE buttons.


8.6.2. Advanced Replication Creation
------------------------------------

The advanced replication creation screen has more options for fine-
tuning a replication. It also allows creating local replications,
legacy engine replications from FreeNAS^® 11.1 or earlier, or even
creating a one-time replication that is not linked to a periodic
snapshot task.

Go to System ‣ Replication Tasks, click ADD and ADVANCED REPLICATION
CREATION to see these options. This screen is also displayed after
clicking  (Options) and Edit for an existing replication.

The Transport value changes many of the options for replication. Table
%s shows abbreviated names of the Transport methods in the "Transport"
column to identify fields which appear when that method is selected.

   * "ALL": All Transport methods

   * "SSH": *SSH*

8.6.3. Replication Tasks
------------------------

Saved replications are shown on the Replication Tasks page.

   [image]Replication Task List

The replication name and configuration details are shown in the list.
To adjust the default table view, open the COLUMNS menu and select the
replication details to show in the normal table view.

The State column shows the status of the replication task. To view the
detailed replication logs for a task, click the State entry when the
task is running or finished.

Expanding an entry shows additional buttons for starting or editing a
replication task.


8.6.4. Limiting Replication Times
---------------------------------

The Schedule, Begin, and End times in a replication task make it
possible to restrict when replication is allowed. These times can be
set to only allow replication after business hours, or at other times
when disk or network activity will not slow down other operations like
snapshots or Scrub Tasks. The default settings allow replication to
occur at any time.

These times control when replication task are allowed to start, but
will not stop a replication task that is already running. Once a
replication task has begun, it will run until finished.


8.6.5. Troubleshooting Replication
----------------------------------

Replication depends on SSH, disks, network, compression, and
encryption to work. A failure or misconfiguration of any of these can
prevent successful replication.

Replication logs are saved in "var/log/zettarepl.log". Logs of
individual replication tasks can be viewed by clicking the replication
State.


8.6.5.1. SSH
~~~~~~~~~~~~

SSH must be able to connect from the source system to the destination
system with an encryption key. This is tested from Shell by making an
SSH connection from the source system to the destination system. For
example, this is a connection from *Alpha* to *Beta* at *10.0.0.118*.
Start the Shell on the source machine (*Alpha*), then enter this
command:

   ssh -vv 10.0.0.118

On the first connection, the system might say

   No matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Verify that this is the correct destination computer from the
preceding information on the screen and type "yes". At this point, an
SSH shell connection is open to the destination system, *Beta*.

If a password is requested, SSH authentication is not working. An SSH
key value must be present in the destination system
"/root/.ssh/authorized_keys" file. "/var/log/auth.log" file can show
diagnostic errors for login problems on the destination computer also.


8.6.5.2. Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matching compression and decompression programs must be available on
both the source and destination computers. This is not a problem when
both computers are running FreeNAS^®, but other operating systems
might not have *lz4*, *pigz*, or *plzip* compression programs
installed by default. An easy way to diagnose the problem is to set
Replication Stream Compression to *Off*. If the replication runs,
select the preferred compression method and check "/var/log/debug.log"
on the FreeNAS^® system for errors.


8.6.5.3. Manual Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On *Alpha*, the source computer, the "/var/log/messages" file can also
show helpful messages to locate the problem.

On the source computer, *Alpha*, open a Shell and manually send a
single snapshot to the destination computer, *Beta*. The snapshot used
in this example is named "auto-20161206.1110-2w". As before, it is
located in the *alphapool/alphadata* dataset. A "@" symbol separates
the name of the dataset from the name of the snapshot in the command.

   zfs send alphapool/alphadata@auto-20161206.1110-2w | ssh 10.0.0.118 zfs recv betapool

If a snapshot of that name already exists on the destination computer,
the system will refuse to overwrite it with the new snapshot. The
existing snapshot on the destination computer can be deleted by
opening a Shell on *Beta* and running this command:

   zfs destroy -R betapool/alphadata@auto-20161206.1110-2w

Then send the snapshot manually again. Snapshots on the destination
system, *Beta*, are listed from the Shell with "zfs list -t snapshot"
or from Storage ‣ Snapshots.

Error messages here can indicate any remaining problems.


8.7. Resilver Priority
======================

Resilvering, or the process of copying data to a replacement disk, is
best completed as quickly as possible. Increasing the priority of
resilvers can help them to complete more quickly. The Resilver
Priority menu makes it possible to increase the priority of
resilvering at times where the additional I/O or CPU usage will not
affect normal usage. Select Tasks ‣ Resilver Priority to display the
screen shown in Figure %s. Table %s describes the fields on this
screen.

+------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+


8.8. Scrub Tasks
================

A scrub is the process of ZFS scanning through the data on a pool.
Scrubs help to identify data integrity problems, detect silent data
corruptions caused by transient hardware issues, and provide early
alerts of impending disk failures. FreeNAS^® makes it easy to schedule
periodic automatic scrubs.

It is recommneded that each pool is scrubbed at least once a month.
Bit errors in critical data can be detected by ZFS, but only when that
data is read. Scheduled scrubs can find bit errors in rarely-read
data. The amount of time needed for a scrub is proportional to the
quantity of data on the pool. Typical scrubs take several hours or
longer.

The scrub process is I/O intensive and can negatively impact
performance. Schedule scrubs for evenings or weekends to minimize
impact to users. Make certain that scrubs and other disk-intensive
activity like S.M.A.R.T. Tests are scheduled to run on different days
to avoid disk contention and extreme performance impacts.

Scrubs only check used disk space. To check unused disk space,
schedule S.M.A.R.T. Tests of Type *Long Self-Test* to run once or
twice a month.

Scrubs are scheduled and managed with Tasks ‣ Scrub Tasks.

When a pool is created, a scrub is automatically scheduled. An entry
with the same pool name is added to Tasks ‣ Scrub Tasks. A summary of
this entry can be viewed with Tasks ‣ Scrub Tasks. Figure %s displays
the default settings for the pool named "pool1". In this example, 
(Options) and Edit for a pool is clicked to display the Edit screen.
Table %s summarizes the options in this screen.

|                  |                               | the scrub is successful, it continues to check daily but does not run again until seven days have elapsed.    |
|                  |                               | Using a multiple of seven ensures the scrub always occurs on the same weekday.                                |

+------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Review the default selections and, if necessary, modify them to meet
the needs of the environment. Scrub tasks cannot run for locked or
unmounted pools.

Scheduled scrubs can be deleted with the Delete button, but this is
not recommended. **Scrubs can provide an early indication of disk
issues before a disk failure.** If a scrub is too intensive for the
hardware, consider temporarily deselecting the Enabled button for the
scrub until the hardware can be upgraded.


8.9. Cloud Sync Tasks
=====================

Files or directories can be synchronized to remote cloud storage
providers with the Cloud Sync Tasks feature.

Warning:

  This Cloud Sync task might go to a third party commercial vendor not
  directly affiliated with iXsystems. Please investigate and fully
  understand that vendor's pricing policies and services before
  creating any Cloud Sync task. iXsystems is not responsible for any
  charges incurred from the use of third party vendors with the Cloud
  Sync feature.

Cloud Credentials must be defined before a cloud sync is created. One
set of credentials can be used for more than one cloud sync. For
example, a single set of credentials for Amazon S3 can be used for
separate cloud syncs that push different sets of files or directories.

A cloud storage area must also exist. With Amazon S3, these are called
*buckets*. The bucket must be created before a sync task can be
created.

After the cloud credentials have been configured, Tasks ‣ Cloud Sync
Tasks is used to define the schedule for running a cloud sync task.
The time selected is when the Cloud Sync task is allowed to begin. An
in-progress cloud sync must complete before another cloud sync can
start. The cloud sync runs until finished, even after the selected
ending time. To stop the cloud sync task before it is finished, click
 (Options) ‣ Stop.

An example is shown in Figure %s.

   [image]Cloud Sync Status

The cloud sync Status indicates the state of most recent cloud sync.
Clicking the Status entry shows the task logs and includes an option
to download them.

Click ADD to display the Add Cloud Sync menu shown in Figure %s.

   [image]Adding a Cloud Sync

Table %s shows the configuration options for Cloud Syncs.

There are specific circumstances where a *SYNC* task does not delete
files from the destination:

* If rclone sync encounters any errors, files are not deleted in the
  destination. This includes a common error when the Dropbox copyright
  detector flags a file as copyrighted.

* Syncing to a B2 bucket does not delete files from the bucket, even
  when those files have been deleted locally. Instead, files are
  tagged with a version number or moved to a hidden state. To
  automatically delete old or unwanted files from the bucket, adjust
  the Backblaze B2 Lifecycle Rules

* Files stored in Amazon S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive cannot
  be deleted by rclone sync. These files must first be restored by
  another means, like the Amazon S3 console.

To modify an existing cloud sync, click  (Options) to access the Run
Now, Edit, and Delete options.


8.9.1. Cloud Sync Example
-------------------------

This example shows a *Push* cloud sync that copies files from a
FreeNAS^® pool to a cloud service provider.

The cloud service provider was configured with a location to store
data received from the FreeNAS^® system.

In the FreeNAS^® web interface, go to System ‣ Cloud Credentials and
click ADD to configure the cloud service provider credentials:

   [image]Example: Adding Cloud Credentials

Go to Tasks ‣ Cloud Sync and click ADD to create a cloud sync job. The
Description is filled with a simple note describing the job. Data is
being sent to cloud storage, so this is a *Push*. The provider comes
from the cloud credentials defined in the previous step, and the
destination folder was configured in the cloud provider account.

The Directory/Files is set to the file or directory to copy to the
cloud provider.

The Transfer Mode is set to *COPY* so that only the files stored by
the cloud provider are modified.

The remaining requirement is to schedule the task. The default is to
send the data to cloud storage daily, but the schedule can be
customized to fine-tune when the task runs.

The Enabled field is enabled by default, so this cloud sync will run
at the next scheduled time.

An example of a completed cloud sync task is shown in Figure %s:
