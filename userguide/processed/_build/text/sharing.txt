13. Sharing
***********

Shares provide and control access to an area of storage. Consider
factors like operating system, security, transfer speed, and user
access before creating a new share. This information can help
determine the type of share, if multiple datasets are needed to divide
the storage into areas with different access and permissions, and the
complexity of setting up permissions.

Note that shares are only used to provide access to data. Deleting a
share configuration does not affect the data that was being shared.

These types of shares and services are available:

* AFP: Apple Filing Protocol shares are used when the client computers
  all run macOS. Apple has deprecated AFP in favor of SMB. Using AFP
  in modern networks is no longer recommended.

* Unix (NFS): Network File System shares are accessible from macOS,
  Linux, BSD, and the professional and enterprise versions (but not
  the home editions) of Windows. This can be a good choice when the
  client computers do not all run the same operating system but NFS
  client software is available for all of them.

* WebDAV: WebDAV shares are accessible using an authenticated web
  browser (read-only) or WebDAV client running on any operating
  system.

* SMB: Server Message Block shares, also known as Common Internet File
  System (CIFS) shares, are accessible by Windows, macOS, Linux, and
  BSD computers. Access is slower than an NFS share due to the single-
  threaded design of Samba. SMB provides more configuration options
  than NFS and is a good choice on a network for Windows or Mac
  systems. However, it is a poor choice if the CPU on the FreeNAS^®
  system is limited. If it is maxed out, upgrade the CPU or consider a
  different type of share.

* Block (iSCSI): Block or iSCSI shares appear as an unformatted disk
  to clients running iSCSI initiator software or a virtualization
  solution such as VMware. These are usually used as virtual drives.

Fast access from any operating system can be obtained by configuring
the FTP service instead of a share and using a cross-platform FTP file
manager application such as Filezilla. Secure FTP can be configured if
the data needs to be encrypted.

When data security is a concern and the network users are familiar
with SSH command line utilities or WinSCP, consider using the SSH
service instead of a share. It is slower than unencrypted FTP due to
the encryption overhead, but the data passing through the network is
encrypted.

Note:

  It is generally a mistake to share a pool or dataset with more than
  one share type or access method. Different types of shares and
  services use different file locking methods. For example, if the
  same pool is configured to use both NFS and FTP, NFS will lock a
  file for editing by an NFS user, but an FTP user can simultaneously
  edit or delete that file. This results in lost edits and confused
  users. Another example: if a pool is configured for both AFP and
  SMB, Windows users can be confused by the "extra" filenames used by
  Mac files and delete them. This corrupts the files on the AFP share.
  Pick the one type of share or service that makes the most sense for
  the types of clients accessing that pool, and use that single type
  of share or service. To support multiple types of shares, divide the
  pool into datasets and use one dataset per share.

This section demonstrates configuration and fine-tuning of AFP, NFS,
SMB, WebDAV, and iSCSI shares. FTP and SSH configurations are
described in Services.


13.1. Apple (AFP) Shares
========================

FreeNAS^® uses the Netatalk AFP server to share data with Apple
systems. This section describes the configuration screen for fine-
tuning AFP shares. It then provides configuration examples for
configuring Time Machine to back up to a dataset on the FreeNAS^®
system and for connecting to the share from a macOS client.

Create a share by clicking Sharing ‣ Apple (AFP), then ADD.

New AFP shares are visible in the Sharing ‣ Apple (AFP) menu.

The configuration options shown in Figure %s appear after clicking 
(Options) on an existing share, and selecting the Edit option. The
values showing for these options will vary, depending upon the
information given when the share was created.

   [image]Creating an AFP Share

Note:

  Table %s summarizes the options available to fine-tune an AFP share.
  Leaving these options at the default settings is recommended as
  changing them can cause unexpected behavior. Most settings are only
  available with Advanced Mode. Do **not** change an advanced option
  without fully understanding the function of that option. Refer to
  Setting up Netatalk for a more detailed explanation of these
  options.

Note:

  If neither *Hosts Allow* or *Hosts Deny* contains an entry, then AFP
  share access is allowed for any host.If there is a *Hosts Allow*
  list but no *Hosts Deny* list, then only allow hosts on the *Hosts
  Allow* list.If there is a *Hosts Deny* list but no *Hosts Allow*
  list, then allow all hosts that are not on the *Hosts Deny* list.If
  there is both a *Hosts Allow* and *Hosts Deny* list, then allow all
  hosts that are on the *Hosts Allow* list. If there is a host not on
  the *Hosts Allow* and not on the *Hosts Deny* list, then allow it.


13.1.1. Creating AFP Guest Shares
---------------------------------

AFP supports guest logins, meaning that macOS users can access the AFP
share without requiring their user accounts to first be created on or
imported into the FreeNAS^® system.

Note:

  When a guest share is created along with a share that requires
  authentication, AFP only maps users who log in as *guest* to the
  guest share. If a user logs in to the share that requires
  authentication, permissions on the guest share can prevent that user
  from writing to the guest share. The only way to allow both guest
  and authenticated users to write to a guest share is to set the
  permissions on the guest share to *777* or to add the authenticated
  users to a guest group and set the permissions to *77x*.

Before creating a guest share, go to Services ‣ AFP and click the
sliding button to turn on the service. Click  (Configure) to open the
screen shown in Figure %s. For Guest Account, use the drop-down to
select Nobody, set Guest Access, and click SAVE.

   [image]Creating a Guest AFP Share

Next, create a dataset for the guest share. Refer to Adding Datasets
for more information about dataset creation.

After creating the dataset for the guest share, go to Storage ‣ Pools,
click the  (Options) button for the dataset, then click Edit
Permissions. Complete the fields shown in Figure %s.

1. **User:** Use the drop-down to select Nobody.

2. Click SAVE.

   [image]Editing Dataset Permissions for Guest AFP Share

To create a guest AFP share:

1. Go to Sharing ‣ Apple (AFP) Shares and click ADD.

2. Browse to the dataset created for the guest share.

3. Fill out the other required fields, then press SAVE.

macOS users can use Finder to connect to the guest AFP share by
clicking Go ‣ Connect to Server. In the example shown in Figure %s,
the user entered "afp://" followed by the IP address of the FreeNAS^®
system.

Click the Connect button. Once connected, Finder opens automatically.
The name of the AFP share is displayed in the SHARED section in the
left frame and the contents of any data saved in the share is
displayed in the right frame.

To disconnect from the pool, click the eject button in the Shared
sidebar.


13.2. Block (iSCSI)
===================

iSCSI is a protocol standard for the consolidation of storage data.
iSCSI allows FreeNAS^® to act like a storage area network (SAN) over
an existing Ethernet network. Specifically, it exports disk devices
over an Ethernet network that iSCSI clients (called initiators) can
attach to and mount. Traditional SANs operate over fibre channel
networks which require a fibre channel infrastructure such as fibre
channel HBAs, fibre channel switches, and discrete cabling. iSCSI can
be used over an existing Ethernet network, although dedicated networks
can be built for iSCSI traffic in an effort to boost performance.
iSCSI also provides an advantage in an environment that uses Windows
shell programs; these programs tend to filter "Network Location" but
iSCSI mounts are not filtered.

Before configuring the iSCSI service, be familiar with this iSCSI
terminology:

**CHAP:** an authentication method which uses a shared secret and
three-way authentication to determine if a system is authorized to
access the storage device and to periodically confirm that the session
has not been hijacked by another system. In iSCSI, the initiator
(client) performs the CHAP authentication.

**Mutual CHAP:** a superset of CHAP in that both ends of the
communication authenticate to each other.

**Initiator:** a client which has authorized access to the storage
data on the FreeNAS^® system. The client requires initiator software
to initiate the connection to the iSCSI share.

**Target:** a storage resource on the FreeNAS^® system. Every target
has a unique name known as an iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN).

**Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS):** protocol for the automated
discovery of iSCSI devices on a TCP/IP network.

**Extent:** the storage unit to be shared. It can either be a file or
a device.

**Portal:** indicates which IP addresses and ports to listen on for
connection requests.

**LUN:** *Logical Unit Number* representing a logical SCSI device. An
initiator negotiates with a target to establish connectivity to a LUN.
The result is an iSCSI connection that emulates a connection to a SCSI
hard disk. Initiators treat iSCSI LUNs as if they were a raw SCSI or
SATA hard drive. Rather than mounting remote directories, initiators
format and directly manage filesystems on iSCSI LUNs. When configuring
multiple iSCSI LUNs, create a new target for each LUN. Since iSCSI
multiplexes a target with multiple LUNs over the same TCP connection,
there can be TCP contention when more than one target accesses the
same LUN. FreeNAS^® supports up to 1024 LUNs.

In FreeNAS^®, iSCSI is built into the kernel. This version of iSCSI
supports Microsoft Offloaded Data Transfer (ODX), meaning that file
copies happen locally, rather than over the network. It also supports
the VAAI (vStorage APIs for Array Integration) primitives for
efficient operation of storage tasks directly on the NAS. To take
advantage of the VAAI primitives, create a zvol and use it to create a
device extent.


13.2.1. iSCSI Wizard
--------------------

To configure iSCSI, click WIZARD and follow each step:

1. **Create or Choose Block Device**:

   * Name: Enter a name for the block device. Keeping the name short
     is recommended. Using a name longer than 63 characters can
     prevent access to the block device.

   * Type: Select *File* or *Device* as the type of block device.
     *Device* provides virtual storage access to zvols, zvol
     snapshots, or physical devices. *File* provides virtual storage
     access to an individual file.

   * Device: Select the unformatted disk, controller, zvol, or zvol
     snapshot. Select *Create New* for options to create a new zvol.
     If *Create New* is selected, use the browser to select an
     existing pool or dataset to store the new zvol. Enter the desired
     size of the zvol in Size. Only displayed when Type is set to
     *Device*.

   * File: Browse to an existing file. Create a new file by browsing
     to a dataset and appending the file name to the path. When the
     file already exists, enter a size of *0* to use the actual file
     size. For new files, enter the size of the file to create. Only
     displayed when Type is set to *File*.

   * What are you using this for: Choose the platform that will use
     this share. The associated options are applied to this share.

2. **Portal**

   * Portal: Select an existing portal or choose *Create New* to
     configure a new portal.

   * Discovery Auth Method: *NONE* allows anonymous discovery while
     *CHAP* and *Mutual CHAP* require authentication.

   * Discovery Auth Group: Choose an existing Authorized Access group
     ID or create a new authorized access. This is required when the
     Discovery Auth Method is set to *CHAP* or *Mutual CHAP*.

   * IP: Select IP addresses to be listened on by the portal. Click
     ADD to add IP addresses with a different network port. The
     address "0.0.0.0" can be selected to listen on all IPv4
     addresses, or "::" to listen on all IPv6 addresses.

   * Port: TCP port used to access the iSCSI target. Default is
     *3260*.

3. **Initiator**

   * Initiators: Leave blank to allow all or enter a list of initiator
     hostnames separated by spaces.

   * Authorized Networks: Network addresses allowed to use this
     initiator. Leave blank to allow all networks or list network
     addresses with a CIDR mask. Separate multiple addresses with a
     space: "192.168.2.0/24 192.168.2.1/12".

4. **Confirm Options**

   * Review the configuration and click SUBMIT to set up the iSCSI
     share.

The rest of this section describes iSCSI configuration in more detail.


13.2.2. Target Global Configuration
-----------------------------------

Sharing ‣ Block (iSCSI) ‣ Target Global Configuration contains
settings that apply to all iSCSI shares. Table %s describes each
option.

Some built-in values affect iSNS usage. Fetching of allowed initiators
from iSNS is not implemented, so target ACLs must be configured
manually. To make iSNS registration useful, iSCSI targets should have
explicitly configured port IP addresses. This avoids initiators
attempting to discover unconfigured target portal addresses like
*0.0.0.0*.

The iSNS registration period is *900* seconds. Registered Network
Entities not updated during this period are unregistered. The timeout
for iSNS requests is *5* seconds.

|                         |             | *Mutual CHAP* both require authentication.                                    |

|                         | menu        | addresses with a different network port. The address "0.0.0.0" can be         |
|                         |             | selected to listen on all IPv4 addresses, or "::" to listen on all IPv6       |
|                         |             | addresses.                                                                    |

+-------------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

FreeNAS^® systems with multiple IP addresses or interfaces can use a
portal to provide services on different interfaces or subnets. This
can be used to configure multi-path I/O (MPIO). MPIO is more efficient
than a link aggregation.

If the FreeNAS^® system has multiple configured interfaces, portals
can also be used to provide network access control. For example,
consider a system with four interfaces configured with these
addresses:

192.168.1.1/24

192.168.2.1/24

192.168.3.1/24

192.168.4.1/24

A portal containing the first two IP addresses (group ID 1) and a
portal containing the remaining two IP addresses (group ID 2) could be
created. Then, a target named A with a Portal Group ID of 1 and a
second target named B with a Portal Group ID of 2 could be created. In
this scenario, the iSCSI service would listen on all four interfaces,
but connections to target A would be limited to the first two networks
and connections to target B would be limited to the last two networks.

Another scenario would be to create a portal which includes every IP
address **except** for the one used by a management interface. This
would prevent iSCSI connections to the management interface.


13.2.4. Initiators
------------------

The next step is to configure authorized initiators, or the systems
which are allowed to connect to the iSCSI targets on the FreeNAS^®
system. To configure which systems can connect, go to Sharing ‣ Block
(iSCSI) ‣ Initiators and click ADD as shown in Figure %s.

Table %s summarizes the settings that can be configured when adding an
initiator.

Click  (Options) on an initiator entry for options to Edit or Delete
it.


13.2.5. Authorized Access
-------------------------

When using CHAP or mutual CHAP to provide authentication, creating
authorized access is recommended. Do this by going to Sharing ‣ Block
(iSCSI) ‣ Authorized Access and clicking ADD. The screen is shown in
Figure %s.

Note:

  This screen sets login authentication. This is different from
  discovery authentication which is set in Global Configuration.

Table %s summarizes the settings that can be configured when adding an
authorized access:

|               |             | inherit the Group *1* authentication profile. Group IDs that are already configured with authorized access cannot be reused.       |
+---------------+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| User          | string      | User account to create for CHAP authentication with the user on the remote system. Many initiators use the initiator name as the   |

+---------------+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Peer User     | string      | Only entered when configuring mutual CHAP. Usually the same value as User.                                                         |
+---------------+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Peer Secret   | string      | Mutual secret password. Required when Peer User is set. Must be different than the Secret. Must be at least *12* and no more than  |
|               |             | *16* characters long.                                                                                                              |
+---------------+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note:

  CHAP does not work with GlobalSAN initiators on macOS.

New authorized accesses are visible from the Sharing ‣ Block (iSCSI) ‣
Authorized Access menu. In the example shown in Figure %s, three users
(*test1*, *test2*, and *test3*) and two groups (*1* and *2*) have been
created, with group 1 consisting of one CHAP user and group 2
consisting of one mutual CHAP user and one CHAP user. Click an
authorized access entry to display its Edit and Delete buttons.

   [image]Viewing Authorized Accesses


13.2.6. Targets
---------------

Next, create a Target by going to Sharing ‣ Block (iSCSI) ‣ Targets
and clicking ADD as shown in Figure %s. A target combines a portal ID,
allowed initiator ID, and an authentication method. Table %s
summarizes the settings that can be configured when creating a Target.

Note:

  An iSCSI target creates a block device that may be accessible to
  multiple initiators. A clustered filesystem is required on the block
  device, such as VMFS used by VMware ESX/ESXi, in order for multiple
  initiators to mount the block device read/write. If a traditional
  filesystem such as EXT, XFS, FAT, NTFS, UFS, or ZFS is placed on the
  block device, care must be taken that only one initiator at a time
  has read/write access or the result will be filesystem corruption.
  If multiple clients need access to the same data on a non-clustered
  filesystem, use SMB or NFS instead of iSCSI, or create multiple
  iSCSI targets (one per client).

+-------------------------------+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


13.2.7. Extents
---------------

iSCSI targets provide virtual access to resources on the FreeNAS^®
system. *Extents* are used to define resources to share with clients.
There are two types of extents: *device* and *file*.

**Device extents** provide virtual storage access to zvols, zvol
snapshots, or physical devices like a disk, an SSD, or a hardware RAID
volume.

**File extents** provide virtual storage access to an individual file.

Tip:

  **For typical use as storage for virtual machines where the
  virtualization software is the iSCSI initiator, device extents with
  zvols provide the best performance and most features.** For other
  applications, device extents sharing a raw device can be
  appropriate. File extents do not have the performance or features of
  device extents, but do allow creating multiple extents on a single
  filesystem.

Virtualized zvols support all the FreeNAS^® VAAI primitives and are
recommended for use with virtualization software as the iSCSI
initiator.

The ATS, WRITE SAME, XCOPY and STUN, primitives are supported by both
file and device extents. The UNMAP primitive is supported by zvols and
raw SSDs. The threshold warnings primitive is fully supported by zvols
and partially supported by file extents.

Virtualizing a raw device like a single disk or hardware RAID volume
limits performance to the abilities of the device. Because this
bypasses ZFS, such devices do not benefit from ZFS caching or provide
features like block checksums or snapshots.

Virtualizing a zvol adds the benefits of ZFS, such as read and write
cache. Even if the client formats a device extent with a different
filesystem, the data still resides on a ZFS pool and benefits from ZFS
features like block checksums and snapshots.

Warning:

  For performance reasons and to avoid excessive fragmentation, keep
  the used space of the pool below 80% when using iSCSI. The capacity
  of an existing extent can be increased as shown in Growing LUNs.

To add an extent, go to Sharing ‣ Block (iSCSI) ‣ Extents and click
ADD. In the example shown in Figure %s, the device extent is using the
"export" zvol that was previously created from the "/mnt/pool1" pool.

Table %s summarizes the settings that can be configured when creating
an extent. Note that **file extent creation fails unless the name of
the file to be created is appended to the pool or dataset name.**

New extents have been added to Sharing ‣ Block (iSCSI) ‣ Extents. The
associated Serial and Network Address Authority (NAA) are shown along
with the extent name.


13.2.8. Associated Targets
--------------------------

The last step is associating an extent to a target by going to Sharing
‣ Block (iSCSI) ‣ Associated Targets and clicking ADD. The screen is
shown in Figure %s. Use the drop-down menus to select the existing
target and extent. Click SAVE to add an entry for the LUN.

   [image]Associating a Target With an Extent

Table %s summarizes the settings that can be configured when
associating targets and extents.


Associated Target Configuration Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+---------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Setting       | Value            | Description                                                 |
|===============|==================|=============================================================|
| Target        | drop-down menu   | Select an existing target.                                  |

| LUN ID        | integer          | Select or enter a value between *0* and *1023*. Some        |
|               |                  | initiators expect a value less than *256*. Leave this field |
|               |                  | blank to automatically assign the next available ID.        |
+---------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Extent        | drop-down menu   | Select an existing extent.                                  |
+---------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Always associating extents to targets in a one-to-one manner is
recommended, even though the web interface will allow multiple extents
to be associated with the same target.

Note:

  Each LUN entry has Edit and Delete buttons for modifying the
  settings or deleting the LUN entirely. A verification popup appears
  when the Delete button is clicked. If an initiator has an active
  connection to the LUN, it is indicated in red text. Clearing the
  initiator connections to a LUN before deleting it is recommended.

After iSCSI has been configured, remember to start the service in
Services ‣ iSCSI by clicking the  (Power) button.


13.2.9. Connecting to iSCSI
---------------------------

To access the iSCSI target, clients must use iSCSI initiator software.

An iSCSI Initiator client is pre-installed with Windows 7. A detailed
how-to for this client can be found here. A client for Windows 2000,
XP, and 2003 can be found here. This How-to shows how to create an
iSCSI target for a Windows 7 system.

macOS does not include an initiator. globalSAN is a commercial, easy-
to-use Mac initiator.

BSD systems provide command line initiators: iscontrol(8) comes with
FreeBSD versions 9.x and lower, iscsictl(8) comes with FreeBSD
versions 10.0 and higher, iscsi-initiator(8) comes with NetBSD, and
iscsid(8) comes with OpenBSD.

Some Linux distros provide the command line utility **iscsiadm** from
Open-iSCSI. Use a web search to see if a package exists for the
distribution should the command not exist on the Linux system.

If a LUN is added while **iscsiadm** is already connected, it will not
see the new LUN until rescanned with **iscsiadm -m node -R**.
Alternately, use **iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p portal_IP** to find
the new LUN and **iscsiadm -m node -T LUN_Name -l** to log into the
LUN.

Instructions for connecting from a VMware ESXi Server can be found at
How to configure FreeNAS 8 for iSCSI and connect to ESX(i). Note that
the requirements for booting vSphere 4.x off iSCSI differ between ESX
and ESXi. ESX requires a hardware iSCSI adapter while ESXi requires
specific iSCSI boot firmware support. The magic is on the booting host
side, meaning that there is no difference to the FreeNAS^®
configuration. See the iSCSI SAN Configuration Guide for details.

The VMware firewall only allows iSCSI connections on port *3260* by
default. If a different port has been selected, outgoing connections
to that port must be manually added to the firewall before those
connections will work.

If the target can be seen but does not connect, check the Discovery
Auth settings in Target Global Configuration.

If the LUN is not discovered by ESXi, make sure that promiscuous mode
is set to Accept in the vSwitch.


13.2.10. Growing LUNs
---------------------

The method used to grow the size of an existing iSCSI LUN depends on
whether the LUN is backed by a file extent or a zvol. Both methods are
described in this section.

Enlarging a LUN with one of the methods below gives it more
unallocated space, but does not automatically resize filesystems or
other data on the LUN. This is the same as binary-copying a smaller
disk onto a larger one. More space is available on the new disk, but
the partitions and filesystems on it must be expanded to use this new
space. Resizing virtual disk images is usually done from virtual
machine management software. Application software to resize
filesystems is dependent on the type of filesystem and client, but is
often run from within the virtual machine. For instance, consider a
Windows VM with the last partition on the disk holding an NTFS
filesystem. The LUN is expanded and the partition table edited to add
the new space to the last partition. The Windows disk manager must
still be used to resize the NTFS filesystem on that last partition to
use the new space.


13.2.10.1. Zvol Based LUN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To grow a zvol-based LUN, go to Storage ‣ Pools, click  (Options) on
the zvol to be grown, then click Edit zvol. In the example shown in
Figure %s, the current size of the zvol named *zvol1* is 4 GiB.

   [image]Editing an Existing Zvol

Enter the new size for the zvol in the Size for this zvol field and
click SAVE. The new size for the zvol is immediately shown in the Used
column of the Storage ‣ Pools table.

Note:

  The web interface does not allow reducing the size of the zvol, as
  doing so could result in loss of data. It also does not allow
  increasing the size of the zvol past 80% of the pool size.


13.2.10.2. File Extent Based LUN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To grow a file extent-based LUN:

Go to Services ‣ iSCSI ‣ CONFIGURE ‣ Extents. Click  (Options), then
Edit. Ensure the Extent Type is set to file and enter the Path to the
extent. Open the Shell to grow the file extent. This example grows
"/mnt/pool1/data" by 2 GiB:

   truncate -s +2g /mnt/pool1/data

Return to Services ‣ iSCSI ‣ CONFIGURE ‣ Extents, click  (Options) on
the desired file extent, then click Edit. Set the size to *0* as this
causes the iSCSI target to use the new size of the file.


13.3. Unix (NFS) Shares
=======================

FreeNAS^® supports sharing pools, datasets, and directories over the
Network File System (NFS). Clients use the **mount** command to mount
the share. Mounted NFS shares appear as another directory on the
client system. Some Linux distros require the installation of
additional software to mount an NFS share. Windows systems must enable
Services for NFS in the Ultimate or Enterprise editions or install an
NFS client application.

Note:

  For performance reasons, iSCSI is preferred to NFS shares when
  FreeNAS^® is installed on ESXi. When considering creating NFS shares
  on ESXi, read through the performance analysis presented in Running
  ZFS over NFS as a VMware Store.

Create an NFS share by going to Sharing ‣ Unix (NFS) Shares and
clicking ADD. Figure %s shows an example of creating an NFS share.

   [image]NFS Share Creation

Remember these points when creating NFS shares:

1. Clients specify the Path when mounting the share.

2. The Maproot and Mapall options cannot both be enabled. The Mapall
   options supersede the Maproot options. To restrict only the *root*
   user permissions, set the Maproot option. To restrict permissions
   of all users, set the Mapall options.

3. Each pool or dataset is considered to be a unique filesystem.
   Individual NFS shares cannot cross filesystem boundaries. Adding
   paths to share more directories only works if those directories are
   within the same filesystem.

4. The network and host must be unique to both each created share and
   the filesystem or directory included in that share. Because
   "/etc/exports" is not an access control list (ACL), the rules
   contained in "/etc/exports" become undefined with overlapping
   networks or when using the same share with multiple hosts.

5. The All dirs option can only be used once per share per filesystem.

To better understand these restrictions, consider scenarios where
there are:

* two networks, *10.0.0.0/8* and *20.0.0.0/8*

* a ZFS pool named "pool1" with a dataset named "dataset1"

* "dataset1" contains directories named "directory1", "directory2",
  and "directory3"

Because of restriction #3, an error is shown when trying to create one
NFS share like this:

* Authorized Networks set to *10.0.0.0/8 20.0.0.0/8*

* Path set to the dataset "/mnt/pool1/dataset1". An additional path to
  directory "/mnt/pool1/dataset1/directory1" is added.

The correct method to configure this share is to set the Path to
"/mnt/pool1/dataset1" and set the All dirs box. This allows the client
to also mount "/mnt/pool1/dataset1/directory1" when
"/mnt/pool1/dataset1" is mounted.

Additional paths are used to define specific directories to be shared.
For example, "dataset1" has three directories. To share only
"/mnt/pool1/dataset1/directory1" and "/mnt/pool1/dataset1/directory2",
create paths for "directory1" and "directory2" within the share. This
excludes "directory3" from the share.

Restricting a specific directory to a single network is done by
creating a share for the volume or dataset and a share for the
directory within that volume or dataset. Define the authorized
networks for both shares.

First NFS share:

* Authorized Networks set to *10.0.0.0/8*

* Path set to "/mnt/pool1/dataset1"

Second NFS share:

* Authorized Networks set to *20.0.0.0/8*

* Path set to "/mnt/pool1/dataset1/directory1"

This requires the creation of two shares. It cannot be done with only
one share.

Table %s summarizes the available configuration options in the
Sharing/NFS/Add screen. Click ADVANCED MODE to see all settings.

Go to Sharing ‣ Unix (NFS) and click  (Options) and Edit to edit an
existing share. Figure %s shows the configuration screen for the
existing *nfs_share1* share. Options are the same as described in NFS
Share Options.

   [image]NFS Share Settings


13.3.1. Example Configuration
-----------------------------

By default, the Mapall fields are not set. This means that when a user
connects to the NFS share, the user has the permissions associated
with their user account. This is a security risk if a user is able to
connect as *root* as they will have complete access to the share.

A better option is to do this:

1. Specify the built-in *nobody* account to be used for NFS access.

2. In the Change Permissions screen of the pool or dataset that is
   being shared, change the owner and group to *nobody* and set the
   permissions according to the desired requirements.

3. Select *nobody* in the Mapall User and Mapall Group drop-down menus
   for the share in Sharing ‣ Unix (NFS) Shares.

With this configuration, it does not matter which user account
connects to the NFS share, as it will be mapped to the *nobody* user
account and will only have the permissions that were specified on the
pool or dataset. For example, even if the *root* user is able to
connect, it will not gain *root* access to the share.


13.3.2. Connecting to the Share
-------------------------------

The following examples share this configuration:

1. The FreeNAS^® system is at IP address *192.168.2.2*.

2. A dataset named "/mnt/pool1/nfs_share1" is created and the
   permissions set to the *nobody* user account and the *nobody*
   group.

3. An NFS share is created with these attributes:

   * Path: "/mnt/pool1/nfs_share1"

   * Authorized Networks: *192.168.2.0/24*

   * All dirs option is enabled

   * MapAll User is set to *nobody*

   * MapAll Group is set to *nobody*


13.3.2.1. From BSD or Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NFS shares are mounted on BSD or Linux clients with this command
executed as the superuser (*root*) or with **sudo**:

   mount -t nfs 192.168.2.2:/mnt/pool1/nfs_share1 /mnt

* **-t nfs** specifies the filesystem type of the share

* **192.168.2.2** is the IP address of the FreeNAS^® system

* **/mnt/pool/nfs_share1** is the name of the directory to be shared,
  a dataset in this case

* **/mnt** is the mountpoint on the client system. This must be an
  existing, *empty* directory. The data in the NFS share appears in
  this directory on the client computer.

Successfully mounting the share returns to the command prompt without
any status or error messages.

Note:

  If this command fails on a Linux system, make sure that the nfs-
  utils package is installed.

This configuration allows users on the client system to copy files to
and from "/mnt" (the mount point). All files are owned by
*nobody:nobody*. Changes to any files or directories in "/mnt" write
to the FreeNAS^® system "/mnt/pool1/nfs_share1" dataset.

NFS share settings cannot be changed when the share is mounted on a
client computer. The **umount** command is used to unmount the share
on BSD and Linux clients. Run it as the superuser or with **sudo** on
each client computer:

   umount /mnt


13.3.2.2. From Microsoft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows NFS client support varies with versions and releases. For best
results, use Windows (SMB) Shares.


13.3.2.3. From macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A macOS client uses Finder to mount the NFS volume. Go to Go ‣ Connect
to Server. In the Server Address field, enter *nfs://* followed by the
IP address of the FreeNAS^® system, and the name of the pool or
dataset being shared by NFS. The example shown in Figure %s continues
with the example of *192.168.2.2:/mnt/pool1/nfs_share1*.

Finder opens automatically after connecting. The IP address of the
FreeNAS^® system displays in the SHARED section of the left frame and
the contents of the share display in the right frame. Figure %s shows
an example where "/mnt/data" has one folder named "images". The user
can now copy files to and from the share.

   [image]Mounting the NFS Share from macOS

   [image]Viewing the NFS Share in Finder


13.3.3. Troubleshooting NFS
---------------------------

Some NFS clients do not support the NLM (Network Lock Manager)
protocol used by NFS. This is the case if the client receives an error
that all or part of the file may be locked when a file transfer is
attempted. To resolve this error, add the option "-o nolock" when
running the **mount** command on the client to allow write access to
the NFS share.

If a "time out giving up" error is shown when trying to mount the
share from a Linux system, make sure that the portmapper service is
running on the Linux client. If portmapper is running and timeouts are
still shown, force the use of TCP by including "-o tcp" in the
**mount** command.

If a "RPC: Program not registered" error is shown, upgrade to the
latest version of FreeNAS^® and restart the NFS service after the
upgrade to clear the NFS cache.

If clients see "reverse DNS" errors, add the FreeNAS^® IP address in
the Host name database field of Network ‣ Global Configuration.

If clients receive timeout errors when trying to mount the share, add
the client IP address and hostname to the Host name database field in
Network ‣ Global Configuration.

Some older versions of NFS clients default to UDP instead of TCP and
do not auto-negotiate for TCP. By default, FreeNAS^® uses TCP. To
support UDP connections, go to Services ‣ NFS ‣ Configure and enable
the Serve UDP NFS clients option.

The "nfsstat -c" or "nfsstat -s" commands can be helpful to detect
problems from the Shell. A high proportion of retries and timeouts
compared to reads usually indicates network problems.


13.4. WebDAV Shares
===================

In FreeNAS^®, WebDAV shares can be created so that authenticated users
can browse the contents of the specified pool, dataset, or directory
from a web browser.

Configuring WebDAV shares is a two step process. First, create the
WebDAV shares to specify which data can be accessed. Then, configure
the WebDAV service by specifying the port, authentication type, and
authentication password. Once the configuration is complete, the share
can be accessed using a URL in the format:

   protocol://IP_address:port_number/share_name

where:

* **protocol:** is either *http* or *https*, depending upon the
  Protocol configured in Services ‣ WebDAV ‣ CONFIGURE.

* **IP address:** is the IP address or hostname of the FreeNAS^®
  system. Take care when configuring a public IP address to ensure
  that the network firewall only allows access to authorized systems.

* **port_number:** is configured in Services ‣ WebDAV ‣ CONFIGURE. If
  the FreeNAS^® system is to be accessed using a public IP address,
  consider changing the default port number and ensure that the
  network firewall only allows access to authorized systems.

* **share_name:** is configured by clicking Sharing ‣ WebDAV Shares,
  then ADD.

Entering the URL in a web browser brings up an authentication pop-up
message. Enter a username of *webdav* and the password configured in
Services ‣ WebDAV ‣ CONFIGURE.

Warning:

  At this time, only the *webdav* user is supported. For this reason,
  it is important to set a good password for this account and to only
  give the password to users which should have access to the WebDAV
  share.

To create a WebDAV share, go to Sharing ‣ WebDAV Shares and click ADD,
which will open the screen shown in Figure %s.

   [image]Adding a WebDAV Share

Click SAVE to create the share. Then, go to Services ‣ WebDAV and
click the  (Power) button to turn on the service.

After the service starts, review the settings in Services ‣ WebDAV ‣
CONFIGURE as they are used to determine which URL is used to access
the WebDAV share and whether or not authentication is required to
access the share. These settings are described in WebDAV.


13.5. Windows (SMB) Shares
==========================

FreeNAS^® uses Samba to share pools using Microsoft's SMB protocol.
SMB is built into the Windows and macOS operating systems and most
Linux and BSD systems pre-install the Samba client in order to provide
support for SMB. If the distro did not, install the Samba client using
the distro software repository.

The SMB protocol supports many different types of configuration
scenarios, ranging from the simple to complex. The complexity of the
scenario depends upon the types and versions of the client operating
systems that will connect to the share, whether the network has a
Windows server, and whether Active Directory is being used. Depending
on the authentication requirements, it might be necessary to create or
import users and groups.

Samba supports server-side copy of files on the same share with
clients from Windows 8 and higher. Copying between two different
shares is not server-side. Windows 7 clients support server-side
copying with Robocopy.

This chapter starts by summarizing the available configuration
options. It demonstrates some common configuration scenarios as well
as offering some troubleshooting tips. Reading through this entire
chapter before creating any SMB shares is recommended to gain a better
understanding of the configuration scenario that meets the specific
network requirements.

SMB Tips and Tricks shows helpful hints for configuring and managing
SMB networking. The FreeNAS and Samba (CIFS) permissions and Advanced
Samba (CIFS) permissions on FreeNAS videos clarify setting up
permissions on SMB shares. Another helpful reference is Methods For
Fine-Tuning Samba Permissions.

Warning:

  SMB1 is disabled by default for security. If necessary, SMB1 can be
  enabled in Services ‣ SMB Configure.

Figure %s shows the configuration screen that appears after clicking
Sharing ‣ Windows (SMB Shares), then ADD.

   [image]Adding an SMB Share

Table %s summarizes the options available when creating a SMB share.
Some settings are only configurable after clicking the ADVANCED MODE
button. For simple sharing scenarios, ADVANCED MODE options are not
needed. For more complex sharing scenarios, only change an ADVANCED
MODE option after fully understanding the function of that option.
smb.conf(5) provides more details for each configurable option.

Note:

  If neither *Hosts Allow* or *Hosts Deny* contains an entry, then SMB
  share access is allowed for any host.If there is a *Hosts Allow*
  list but no *Hosts Deny* list, then only allow hosts on the *Hosts
  Allow* list.If there is a *Hosts Deny* list but no *Hosts Allow*
  list, then allow all hosts that are not on the *Hosts Deny* list.If
  there is both a *Hosts Allow* and *Hosts Deny* list, then allow all
  hosts that are on the *Hosts Allow* list. If there is a host not on
  the *Hosts Allow* and not on the *Hosts Deny* list, then allow it.

Here are some notes about ADVANCED MODE settings:

* Hostname lookups add some time to accessing the SMB share. If only
  using IP addresses, unset the Hostnames Lookups setting in Services
  ‣ SMB ‣  (Configure).

* When the Browsable to Network Clients option is selected, the share
  is visible through Windows File Explorer or through **net view**.
  When the Use as home share option is selected, deselecting the
  Browsable to Network Clients option hides the share named *homes* so
  that only the dynamically generated share containing the
  authenticated user home directory will be visible. By default, the
  *homes* share and the user home directory are both visible. Users
  are not automatically granted read or write permissions on browsable
  shares. This option provides no real security because shares that
  are not visible in Windows File Explorer can still be accessed with
  a *UNC* path.

* If some files on a shared pool should be hidden and inaccessible to
  users, put a *veto files=* line in the Auxiliary Parameters field.
  The syntax for the veto files option and some examples can be found
  in the smb.conf manual page.

Samba disables NTLMv1 authentication by default for security. Standard
configurations of Windows XP and some configurations of later clients
like Windows 7 will not be able to connect with NTLMv1 disabled.
Security guidance for NTLMv1 and LM network authentication has
information about the security implications and ways to enable NTLMv2
on those clients. If changing the client configuration is not
possible, NTLMv1 authentication can be enabled by selecting the NTLMv1
auth option in Services ‣ SMB ‣  (Configure).

Table %s provides an overview of the available VFS objects. Be sure to
research each object **before** adding or deleting it from the
Selected column of the VFS Objects field of the share. Some objects
need additional configuration after they are added. Refer to Stackable
VFS modules and the vfs_* man pages for more details.

Warning:

  Be careful when using multiple SMB shares, some with and some
  without *fruit*. macOS clients negotiate SMB2 AAPL protocol
  extensions on the first connection to the server, so mixing shares
  with and without fruit will globally disable AAPL if the first
  connection occurs without fruit. To resolve this, all macOS clients
  need to disconnect from all SMB shares and the first reconnection to
  the server has to be to a fruit-enabled share.

These VFS objects do not appear in the drop-down menu:

* **recycle:** moves deleted files to the recycle directory instead of
  deleting them. Controlled by Export Recycle Bin in the SMB share
  options.

Creating or editing an SMB share on a dataset with a trivial Access
Control List (ACL) prompts to configure the ACL for the dataset.

To view all active SMB connections and users, enter **smbstatus** in
the Shell. To log more details for clients that are attempting to
authenticate to an SMB share, open the Service ‣ SMB options and add
"log level = 1, auth_audit:5" to the Auxiliary Parameters.


13.5.1. Configuring Unauthenticated Access
------------------------------------------

SMB supports guest logins, meaning that users can access the SMB share
without needing to provide a username or password. This type of share
is convenient as it is easy to configure, easy to access, and does not
require any users to be configured on the FreeNAS^® system. This type
of configuration is also the least secure as anyone on the network can
access the contents of the share. Additionally, since all access is as
the guest user, even if the user inputs a username or password, there
is no way to differentiate which users accessed or modified the data
on the share. This type of configuration is best suited for small
networks where quick and easy access to the share is more important
than the security of the data on the share.

Note:

  Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 version 1709, and Windows Server
  2019 disable SMB2 guest access. Read the Microsoft security notice
  for details about security vulnerabilities with SMB2 guest access
  and instructions to re-enable guest logins on these Microsoft
  systems.

To configure an unauthenticated SMB share:

1. Go to Sharing ‣ Windows (SMB) Shares and click ADD.

2. Fill out the the fields as shown in Figure %s.

3. Enable Allow Guest Access.

4. Press SAVE.

Note:

  If a dataset for the share has not been created, refer to Adding
  Datasets to find out more about dataset creation.

   [image]Creating an Unauthenticated SMB Share

The new share appears in Sharing ‣ Windows (SMB) Shares.

By default, users that access the share from an SMB client will not be
prompted for a username or password. For example, to access the share
from a Windows system, open Explorer and click on Network. In this
example, a system named *FREENAS* appears with a share named
*p2ds2-smb*. The user can copy data to and from this share.

The guest account can be changed by opening the Services ‣ SMB options
and selecting a different account from the Guest Account dropdown.

The guest account can also have an Access Control Entry (ACE) that
governs the permissions of the guest account to access the different
pools and datasets on the system. To change the guest account
permissions, edit the dataset Access Control List (ACL) and add a new
item with the Who set to *User* and User set to the account used for
guest access (*nobody* by default). The ACE can then be adjusted to
define the access level required for guest sessions. See ACL
Management for more details about each available setting.

Changing the Guest Account permissions will not grant access for
anonymous sessions. This is best accomplished by creating or editing
the "everyone@" ACE in the dataset ACL. Note that anonymous sessions
also do not have the guest SID in the security token.


13.5.2. Configuring Authenticated Access With Local Users
---------------------------------------------------------

Most configuration scenarios require each user to have their own user
account and to authenticate before accessing the share. This allows
the administrator to control access to data, provide appropriate
permissions to that data, and to determine who accesses and modifies
stored data. A Windows domain controller is not needed for
authenticated SMB shares, which means that additional licensing costs
are not required. However, because there is no domain controller to
provide authentication for the network, each user account must be
created on the FreeNAS^® system. This type of configuration scenario
is often used in home and small networks as it does not scale well if
many user accounts are needed.

To configure authenticated access for an SMB share, first create a
group for all the SMB user accounts in FreeNAS^®. Go to Accounts ‣
Groups and click ADD. Use a descriptive name for the group like
"local_smb_users".

Configure the SMB share dataset with permissions for this new group.
When creating a new dataset, set the Share Type to *SMB*. After the
dataset is created, open the dataset Access Control List (ACL) and add
a new entry. Set Who to *Group* and select the SMB group for the
Group. Finish defining the permissions for the SMB group. Any members
of this group now have access to the dataset.

   [image]Defining Permissions for a Group

Determine which users need authenticated access to the dataset and
create new accounts in FreeNAS^®. It is recommended to use the same
username and password from the client system for the associated
FreeNAS^® user account. Add the SMB group to the Auxiliary Groups list
during account creation.

Finally, create the SMB share. Make sure the Path is pointed to the
dataset that has defined permissions for the SMB group and that the
SMB service is active.

**Testing the Share**

The authenticated share can be tested from any SMB client. For
example, to test an authenticated share from a Windows system with
network discovery enabled, open Explorer and click on Network. If
network discovery is disabled, open Explorer and enter "{HOST}" in the
address bar, where *HOST* is the IP address or hostname of the share
system. This example shows a system named *FREENAS* with a share named
*smb_share*.

After clicking *smb_share*, a Windows Security dialog prompts for the
username and password of the user associated with *smb_share*. After
authenticating, the user can copy data to and from the SMB share.

Map the share as a network drive to prevent Windows Explorer from
hanging when accessing the share. Right-click the share and select Map
network drive.... Choose a drive letter from the drop-down menu and
click Finish.

Windows caches user account credentials with the authenticated share.
This sometimes prevents connection to a share, even when the correct
username and password are provided. Logging out of Windows clears the
cache. The authentication dialog reappears the next time the user
connects to an authenticated share.


13.5.3. User Quota Administration
---------------------------------

File Explorer can manage quotas on SMB shares connected to an Active
Directory server. Both the share and dataset being shared must be
configured to allow this feature:

* Create an authenticated share with "domain admins" as both the user
  and group name in Ownership.

* Edit the SMB share and add *ixnas* to the list of selected VFS
  Object.

* In Windows Explorer, connect to and map the share with a user
  account which is a member of the "domain admins" group. The Quotas
  tab becomes active.


13.5.4. Configuring Shadow Copies
---------------------------------

Shadow Copies, also known as the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) or
Previous Versions, is a Microsoft service for creating volume
snapshots. Shadow copies can be used to restore previous versions of
files from within Windows Explorer. Shadow Copy support is built into
Vista and Windows 7. Windows XP or 2000 users need to install the
Shadow Copy client.

When a periodic snapshot task is created on a ZFS pool that is
configured as a SMB share in FreeNAS^®, it is automatically configured
to support shadow copies.

Before using shadow copies with FreeNAS^®, be aware of the following
caveats:

* If the Windows system is not fully patched to the latest service
  pack, Shadow Copies may not work. If no previous versions of files
  to restore are visible, use Windows Update to ensure the system is
  fully up-to-date.

* Shadow copy support only works for ZFS pools or datasets. This means
  that the SMB share must be configured on a pool or dataset, not on a
  directory.

* Datasets are filesystems and shadow copies cannot traverse
  filesystems. To see the shadow copies in the child datasets, create
  separate shares for them.

* Shadow copies will not work with a manual snapshot. Creating a
  periodic snapshot task for the pool or dataset being shared by SMB
  or a recursive task for a parent dataset is recommended.

* The periodic snapshot task should be created and at least one
  snapshot should exist **before** creating the SMB share. If the SMB
  share was created first, restart the SMB service in Services.

* Appropriate permissions must be configured on the pool or dataset
  being shared by SMB.

* Users cannot delete shadow copies on the Windows system due to the
  way Samba works. Instead, the administrator can remove snapshots
  from the FreeNAS^® web interface. The only way to disable shadow
  copies completely is to remove the periodic snapshot task and delete
  all snapshots associated with the SMB share.

To configure shadow copy support, use the instructions in Configuring
Authenticated Access With Local Users to create the desired number of
shares.

To enable shadow copies, check the Enable Shadow Copies setting when
creating an smb share.


13.6. Creating Authenticated and Time Machine Shares
====================================================

macOS includes the Time Machine feature which performs automatic
backups. FreeNAS^® supports Time Machine backups for both SMB and AFP
shares. The process for creating an authenticated share for a user is
the same as creating a Time Machine share for that user.

Create Time Machine or authenticated shares on a new dataset.

Change permissions on the new dataset by going to Storage ‣ Pools.
Select the dataset, click  (Options), Change Permissions.

Enter these settings:

1. **User:** Use the drop-down to select the desired user account. If
   the user does not yet exist on the FreeNAS^® system, create one
   with Accounts ‣ Users. See users for more information.

2. **Group:** Select the desired group name. If the group does not yet
   exist on the FreeNAS^® system, create one with Accounts ‣ Groups.
   See groups for more information.

3. Click SAVE.

Create the authenticated or Time Machine share:

1. Go to Sharing ‣ Windows (SMB) Shares or Sharing ‣ Apple (AFP)
   Shares and click ADD. Apple deprecated the AFP protocol and
   recommends using SMB.

2. Browse to the dataset created for the share.

3. When creating a Time Machine share, set the Time Machine option.

4. Fill out the other required fields.

5. Click SAVE.

When creating multiple authenticated or Time Machine shares, repeat
this process for each user. Figure %s shows creating a Time Machine
Share in Sharing ‣ Apple (AFP) Shares.

   [image]Creating an Authenticated or Time Machine Share

Configuring a quota for each Time Machine share helps prevent backups
from using all available space on the FreeNAS^® system. Time Machine
waits two minutes before creating a full backup. It then creates
ongoing hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly backups. **The oldest
backups are deleted when a Time Machine share fills up, so make sure
that the quota size is large enough to hold the desired number of
backups.** Note that a default installation of macOS is over 20 GiB.

Configure a global quota using the instructions in Set up Time Machine
for multiple machines with OSX Server-Style Quotas or create
individual share quotas.


13.6.1. Setting SMB and AFP Share Quotas
----------------------------------------

**SMB Quota**

Go to Sharing ‣ Windows (SMB) Shares, click  (Options) on the Time
Machine share, and Edit. Click Advanced Mode and enter a vfs_fruit(8)
parameter in the Auxiliary Parameters. Time Machine quotas use the
**fruit:time machine max size** parameter. For example, to set a quota
of *500 GiB*, enter "fruit:time machine max size = 500 G".

**AFP Quota**

Go to Sharing ‣ Apple (AFP) Shares, click  (Options) on the Time
Machine share, and Edit. In the example shown in Figure %s, the Time
Machine share name is *backup_user1*. Enter a value in the Time
Machine Quota field, and click SAVE. In this example, the Time Machine
share is restricted to 200 GiB.

   [image]Setting an AFP Share Quota


13.6.2. Client Time Machine Configuration
-----------------------------------------

Note:

  The example shown here is intended to show the general process of
  adding a FreeNAS^® share in Time Machine. The example might not
  reflect the exact process to configure Time Machine on a specific
  version of macOS. See the Apple documentation for detailed Time
  Machine configuration instructions.

To configure Time Machine on the macOS client, go to System
Preferences ‣ Time Machine, and click ON in the left panel.

   [image]Configuring Time Machine on macOS

Click Select Disk... in the right panel to find the FreeNAS^® system
with the share. Highlight the share and click Use Backup Disk. A
connection dialog prompts to log in to the FreeNAS^® system.

If "Time Machine could not complete the backup. The backup disk image
could not be created (error 45)" is shown when backing up to the
FreeNAS^® system, a sparsebundle image must be created using these
instructions.

If "Time Machine completed a verification of your backups. To improve
reliability, Time Machine must create a new backup for you." is shown,
follow the instructions in this post to avoid making another backup or
losing past backups.
