17. Reporting
*************

Reporting displays several graphs, as seen in Figure %s. Choose a
category from the drop-down menu to view those graphs. There are also
options to change the graph view and number of graphs on each page.

   [image]Reporting Graphs

FreeNAS^Â® uses collectd to provide reporting statistics. For a clearer
picture, hover over a point in the graph to show exact numbers for
that point in time. Use the magnifier buttons next to each graph to
increase or decrease the displayed time increment from 10 minutes,
hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. The << and >> buttons scroll
through the output.

Note:

  Reporting graphs do not appear if there is no related data.

Graphs are grouped by category on the Reporting page:

* CPU

  * CPU shows the amount of time spent by the CPU in various states
    such as executing user code, executing system code, and being
    idle. Graphs of short-, mid-, and long-term load are shown, along
    with CPU temperature graphs.

* Disk

  * Disk shows read and write statistics on I/O, percent busy,
    latency, operations per second, pending I/O requests, and disk
    temperature. Choose the DEVICES and METRICS to view the selected
    metrics for the chosen devices.

  Note:

    Temperature monitoring for the disk is disabled if HDD Standby is
    enabled in Disks.

* Memory

  * Memory displays memory usage.

  * Swap displays the amount of free and used swap space.

* Network

  * Interface shows received and transmitted traffic in megabytes per
    second for each configured interface.

* NFS

  * NFS shows information about the number of procedure calls for each
    procedure and whether the system is a server or client.

* Partition

  * Disk space displays free, used, and reserved space for each pool
    and dataset. However, the disk space used by an individual zvol is
    not displayed as it is a block device.

* System

  * Processes displays the number of processes. It is grouped by
    state.

* Target

  * Target shows bandwidth statistics for iSCSI ports.

* UPS

  * UPS displays statistics about an uninterruptible power supply
    (UPS) using Network UPS tools. Statistics include voltages,
    currents, power, frequencies, load, and temperatures.

* ZFS

  * ZFS shows compressed physical ARC size, hit ratio, demand data,
    demand metadata, and prefetch data.

Reporting data is saved to permit viewing and monitoring usage trends
over time. This data is preserved across system upgrades and restarts.

Data files are saved in "/var/db/collectd/rrd/".

Warning:

  Reporting data is frequently written and should not be stored on the
  boot pool or operating system device.
