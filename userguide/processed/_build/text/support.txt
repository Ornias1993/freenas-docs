will get a response.


24.4. IRC
=========

To ask a question in real time, use the *#freenas* channel on IRC
Freenode. Depending on the time of day and the time zone, FreeNAS^®
developers or other users may be available to provide assistance. If
no one answers right away, remain on the channel, as other users tend
to read the channel history to answer questions as time permits.

Typically, an IRC client is used to access the *#freenas* IRC channel.
Alternately, use webchat from a web browser.

To get the most out of the IRC channel, keep these points in mind:

* Do not ask "Can anyone help me?". Just ask the question.

* Do not ask a question and leave. Users who know the answer cannot
  help you if you disappear.

* If no one answers, the question may be difficult to answer or it has
  been asked before. Research other resources while waiting for the
  question to be answered.

* Do not post error messages in the channel. Instead, use a pasting
  service such as pastebin and paste the resulting URL into the IRC
  discussion.

A series of instructional videos are available for FreeNAS^®:

* Install Murmur (Mumble server) on FreeNAS/FreeBSD
