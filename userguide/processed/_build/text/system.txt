+------------------------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

After making any changes, click SAVE. Changes to any of the GUI fields
can interrupt web interface connectivity while the new settings are
applied.

This screen also contains these buttons:

* SAVE CONFIG: save a backup copy of the current configuration
  database in the format *hostname-version-architecture* to the
  computer accessing the web interface. Saving the configuration after
  making any configuration changes is highly recommended. FreeNAS^®
  automatically backs up the configuration database to the system
  dataset every morning at 3:45. However, this backup does not occur
  if the system is shut down at that time. If the system dataset is
  stored on the boot pool and the boot pool becomes unavailable, the
  backup will also not be available. The location of the system
  dataset can be viewed or set using System ‣ System Dataset.

  Note:

    SSH keys are not stored in the configuration database and must be
    backed up separately. System host keys are files with names
    beginning with "ssh_host_" in "/usr/local/etc/ssh/". The root user
    keys are stored in "/root/.ssh".

  There are two types of passwords. User account passwords for the
  base operating system are stored as hashed values, do not need to be
  encrypted to be secure, and are saved in the system configuration
  backup. Other passwords, like iSCSI CHAP passwords, Active Directory
  bind credentials, and cloud credentials are stored in an encrypted
  form to prevent them from being visible as plain text in the saved
  system configuration. The key or *seed* for this encryption is
  normally stored only on the operating system device. When Save
  Config is chosen, a dialog gives two options. Export Password Secret
  Seed includes passwords in the configuration file which allows the
  configuration file to be restored to a different operating system
  device where the decryption seed is not already present.
  Configuration backups containing the seed must be physically secured
  to prevent decryption of passwords and unauthorized access.

  Warning:

    The Export Password Secret Seed option is off by default and
    should only be used when making a configuration backup that will
    be stored securely. After moving a configuration to new hardware,
    media containing a configuration backup with a decryption seed
    should be securely erased before reuse.

  Export Pool Encryption Keys includes the encryption keys of
  encrypted pools in the configuration file. The encyrption keys are
  restored if the configuration file is uploaded to the system using
  UPLOAD CONFIG.

* UPLOAD CONFIG: allows browsing to the location of a previously saved
  configuration file to restore that configuration.

* RESET CONFIG: reset the configuration database to the default base
  version. This does not delete user SSH keys or any other data stored
  in a user home directory. Since configuration changes stored in the
  configuration database are erased, this option is useful when a
  mistake has been made or to return a test system to the original
  configuration.


7.2. NTP Servers
================

The network time protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time on the
computers in a network. Accurate time is necessary for the successful
operation of time sensitive applications such as Active Directory or
other directory services. By default, FreeNAS^® is pre-configured to
use three public NTP servers. If the network is using a directory
service, ensure that the FreeNAS^® system and the server running the
directory service have been configured to use the same NTP servers.

Available NTP servers can be found at
https://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers. For time
accuracy, choose NTP servers that are geographically close to the
physical location of the FreeNAS^® system.

Click System ‣ NTP Servers and ADD to add an NTP server. Figure %s
shows the configuration options. Table %s summarizes the options
available when adding or editing an NTP server. ntp.conf(5) explains
these options in more detail.

+---------------+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


7.3. Boot
=========

FreeNAS^® supports a ZFS feature known as multiple boot environments.
With multiple boot environments, the process of updating the operating
system becomes a low-risk operation. The updater automatically creates
a snapshot of the current boot environment and adds it to the boot
menu before applying the update.

If an update fails, reboot the system and select the previous boot
environment, using the instructions in If Something Goes Wrong, to
instruct the system to go back to that system state.

Note:

  Boot environments are separate from the configuration database. Boot
  environments are a snapshot of the *operating system* at a specified
  time. When a FreeNAS^® system boots, it loads the specified boot
  environment, or operating system, then reads the configuration
  database to load the current configuration values. If the intent is
  to make configuration changes rather than operating system changes,
  make a backup of the configuration database first using the
  instructions in System --> General.

The example shown in Figure %s, includes the two boot environments
that are created when FreeNAS^® is installed. The *Initial-Install*
boot environment can be booted into if the system needs to be returned
to a non-configured version of the installation.

   [image]Viewing Boot Environments

Each boot environment entry contains this information:

* **Name:** the name of the boot entry as it will appear in the boot
  menu. Alphanumeric characters, dashes (*-*), underscores (*_*), and
  periods (*.*) are allowed.

* **Active:** indicates which entry will boot by default if the user
  does not select another entry in the boot menu.

* **Created:** indicates the date and time the boot entry was created.

* **Space:** displays the size of the boot environment.

* **Keep:** indicates whether or not this boot environment can be
  pruned if an update does not have enough space to proceed. Click 
  (Options) and Keep for an entry if that boot environment should not
  be automatically pruned.

Click  (Options) on an entry to access actions specific to that
entry:

* **Activate:** only appears on entries which are not currently set to
  Active. Changes the selected entry to the default boot entry on next
  boot. The status changes to Reboot and the current Active entry
  changes from Now/Reboot to Now, indicating that it was used on the
  last boot but will not be used on the next boot.

* **Clone:** makes a new boot environment from the selected boot
  environment. When prompted for the name of the clone, alphanumeric
  characters, dashes (*-*), underscores (*_*), and periods (*.*) are
  allowed.

* **Rename:** used to change the name of the boot environment.
  Alphanumeric characters, dashes (*-*), underscores (*_*), and
  periods (*.*) are allowed.

* **Delete:** used to delete the highlighted entry, which also removes
  that entry from the boot menu. Since an activated entry cannot be
  deleted, this button does not appear for the active boot
  environment. To delete an entry that is currently activated, first
  activate another entry. Note that this button does not appear for
  the *default* boot environment as this entry is needed to return the
  system to the original installation state.

* **Keep:** used to toggle whether or not the updater can prune
  (automatically delete) this boot environment if there is not enough
  space to proceed with the update.

Click ACTIONS to:

* **Add:** make a new boot environment from the active environment.
  The active boot environment contains the text "Now/Reboot" in the
  Active column. Only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes
  are allowed in the Name.

* **Stats/Settings:** display statistics for the operating system
  device: condition, total and used size, and date and time of the
  last scrub. By default, the operating system device is scrubbed
  every 7 days.  To change the default, input a different number in
  the Automatic scrub interval (in days) field and click UPDATE
  INTERVAL.

* **Boot Pool Status:** display the status of each device in the
  operating system device, including any read, write, or checksum
  errors.

* **Scrub Boot Pool:** perform a manual scrub of the operating system
  device.


7.3.1. Operating System Device Mirroring
----------------------------------------

System ‣ Boot ‣ Boot Pool Status is used to manage the devices
comprising the operating system device. An example is seen in Figure
%s.

   [image]Viewing the Status of the Operating System Device

FreeNAS^® supports 2-device mirrors for the operating system device.
In a mirrored configuration, a failed device can be detached and
replaced.

An additional device can be attached to an existing one-device
operating system device, with these caveats:

* The new device must have at least the same capacity as the existing
  device. Larger capacity devices can be added, but the mirror will
  only have the capacity of the smallest device. Different models of
  devices which advertise the same nominal size are not necessarily
  the same actual size. For this reason, adding another device of the
  same model of is recommended.

* It is **strongly recommended** to use SSDs rather than USB devices
  when creating a mirrored operating system device.

Click  (Options) on a device entry to access actions specific to that
device:

* **Attach:** use to add a second device to create a mirrored
  operating system device. If another device is available, it appears
  in the Member disk drop-down menu. Select the desired device. The
  Use all disk space option controls the capacity made available to
  the operating system device. By default, the new device is
  partitioned to the same size as the existing device. When Use all
  disk space is enabled, the entire capacity of the new device is
  used. If the original operating system device fails and is detached,
  the boot mirror will consist of just the newer drive, and will grow
  to whatever capacity it provides. However, new devices added to this
  mirror must now be as large as the new capacity. Click SAVE to
  attach the new disk to the mirror.

* **Detach:** remove the failed device from the mirror so that it can
  be replaced.

* **Replace:** once the failed device has been detached, select the
  new replacement device from the Member disk drop-down menu to
  rebuild the mirror.

7.4.1. Autotune
---------------

FreeNAS^® provides an autotune script which optimizes the system
depending on the installed hardware. For example, if a pool exists on
a system with limited RAM, the autotune script automatically adjusts
some ZFS sysctl values in an attempt to minimize memory starvation
issues. It should only be used as a temporary measure on a system that
hangs until the underlying hardware issue is addressed by adding more
RAM. Autotune will always slow such a system, as it caps the ARC.

The Enable autotune option in System ‣ Advanced is off by default.
Enable this option to run the autotuner at boot. To run the script
immediately, reboot the system.

If the autotune script adjusts any settings, the changed values appear
in System ‣ Tunables. Note that deleting tunables that were created by
autotune only affects the current session, as autotune-set tunables
are recreated at boot. This means that any autotune-set value that is
manually changed will revert back to the value set by autotune on
reboot. To permanently change a value set by autotune, change the
description of the tunable. For example, changing the description to
*manual override* prevents autotune from reverting that tunable back
to the autotune default value.

When attempting to increase the performance of the FreeNAS^® system,
and particularly when the current hardware may be limiting
performance, try enabling autotune.

For those who wish to see which checks are performed, the autotune
script is located in "/usr/local/bin/autotune".


7.4.2. Self-Encrypting Drives
-----------------------------

FreeNAS^® version 11.1-U5 introduced Self-Encrypting Drive (SED)
support.

These SED specifications are supported:

* Legacy interface for older ATA devices. **Not recommended for
  security-critical environments**

* TCG Opal 1 legacy specification

* TCG OPAL 2 standard for newer consumer-grade devices

* TCG Opalite is a reduced form of OPAL 2

* TCG Pyrite Version 1 and Version 2 are similar to Opalite, but
  hardware encryption is removed. Pyrite provides a logical equivalent
  of the legacy ATA security for non-ATA devices. Only the drive
  firmware is used to protect the device.

  Danger:

    Pyrite Version 1 SEDs do not have PSID support and **can become
    unusable if the password is lost.**

* TCG Enterprise is designed for systems with many data disks. These
  SEDs do not have the functionality to be unlocked before the
  operating system boots.

See this Trusted Computing Group^® and NVM Express^® joint white paper
for more details about these specifications.

FreeNAS^® implements the security capabilities of camcontrol for
legacy devices and sedutil-cli for TCG devices. When managing a SED
from the command line, it is recommended to use the **sedhelper**
wrapper script for **sedutil-cli** to ease SED administration and
unlock the full capabilities of the device. Examples of using these
commands to identify and deploy SEDs are provided below.

A SED can be configured before or after assigning the device to a
pool.

By default, SEDs are not locked until the administrator takes
ownership of them. Ownership is taken by explicitly configuring a
global or per-device password in the FreeNAS^® web interface and
adding the password to the SEDs. Adding SED passwords to FreeNAS^®
also allows FreeNAS^® to automatically unlock SEDs.

A password-protected SED protects the data stored on the device when
the device is physically removed from the FreeNAS^® system. This
allows secure disposal of the device without having to first wipe the
contents. Repurposing a SED on another system requires the SED
password.


7.4.2.1. Deploying SEDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run **sedutil-cli --scan** in the Shell to detect and list devices.
The second column of the results identifies the drive type:

* **no** indicates a non-SED device

* **1** indicates a legacy TCG OPAL 1 device

* **2** indicates a modern TCG OPAL 2 device

* **L** indicates a TCG Opalite device

* **p** indicates a TCG Pyrite 1 device

* **P** indicates a TCG Pyrite 2 device

* **E** indicates a TCG Enterprise device

Example:

   root@truenas1:~ # sedutil-cli --scan
   Scanning for Opal compliant disks
   /dev/ada0  No  32GB SATA Flash Drive SFDK003L
   /dev/ada1  No  32GB SATA Flash Drive SFDK003L
   /dev/da0   No  HGST    HUS726020AL4210  A7J0
   /dev/da1   No  HGST    HUS726020AL4210  A7J0
   /dev/da10    E WDC     WUSTR1519ASS201  B925
   /dev/da11    E WDC     WUSTR1519ASS201  B925

FreeNAS^® supports setting a global password for all detected SEDs or
setting individual passwords for each SED. Using a global password for
all SEDs is strongly recommended to simplify deployment and avoid
maintaining separate passwords for each SED.


7.4.2.1.1. Setting a global password for SEDs
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Go to System ‣ Advanced ‣ SED Password and enter the password.
**Record this password and store it in a safe place!**

Now the SEDs must be configured with this password. Go to the Shell
and enter "sedhelper setup *password*", where *password* is the global
password entered in System ‣ Advanced ‣ SED Password.

**sedhelper** ensures that all detected SEDs are properly configured
to use the provided password:

   root@truenas1:~ # sedhelper setup abcd1234
   da9                  [OK]
   da10                 [OK]
   da11                 [OK]

Rerun "sedhelper setup *password*" every time a new SED is placed in
the system to apply the global password to the new SED.


7.4.2.1.2. Creating separate passwords for each SED
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Go to Storage ‣ Disks. Click  (Options) for the confirmed SED, then
Edit. Enter and confirm the password in the SED Password and Confirm
SED Password fields.

The Storage ‣ Disks screen shows which disks have a configured SED
password. The SED Password column shows a mark when the disk has a
password. Disks that are not a SED or are unlocked using the global
password are not marked in this column.

The SED must be configured to use the new password. Go to the Shell
and enter "sedhelper setup --disk *da1* *password*", where *da1* is
the SED to configure and *password* is the created password from
Storage ‣ Disks ‣ Edit Disks ‣ SED Password.

This process must be repeated for each SED and any SEDs added to the
system in the future.

Danger:

  Remember SED passwords! If the SED password is lost, SEDs cannot be
  unlocked and their data is unavailable. Always record SED passwords
  whenever they are configured or modified and store them in a secure
  place!


7.4.2.2. Check SED Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When SED devices are detected during system boot, FreeNAS^® checks for
configured global and device-specific passwords.

Unlocking SEDs allows a pool to contain a mix of SED and non-SED
devices. Devices with individual passwords are unlocked with their
password. Devices without a device-specific password are unlocked
using the global password.

To verify SED locking is working correctly, go to the Shell. Enter
"sedutil-cli --listLockingRange 0 *password* dev/*da1*", where *da1*
is the SED and *password* is the global or individual password for
that SED. The command returns "ReadLockEnabled: 1", "WriteLockEnabled:
1", and "LockOnReset: 1" for drives with locking enabled:

   root@truenas1:~ # sedutil-cli --listLockingRange 0 abcd1234 /dev/da9
   Band[0]:
       Name:            Global_Range
       CommonName:      Locking
       RangeStart:      0
       RangeLength:     0
       ReadLockEnabled: 1
       WriteLockEnabled:1
       ReadLocked:      0
       WriteLocked:     0
       LockOnReset:     1


7.4.2.3. Managing SED Passwords and Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains command line instructions to manage SED
passwords and data. The command used is sedutil-cli(8). Most SEDs are
TCG-E (Enterprise) or TCG-Opal (Opal v2.0). Commands are different for
the different drive types, so the first step is identifying which type
is being used.

Warning:

  These commands can be destructive to data and passwords. Keep
  backups and use the commands with caution.

Check SED version on a single drive, "/dev/da0" in this example:

   root@truenas:~ # sedutil-cli --isValidSED /dev/da0
   /dev/da0 SED --E--- Micron_5N/A U402

All connected disks can be checked at once:

   root@truenas:~ # sedutil-cli --scan
   Scanning for Opal compliant disks
   /dev/ada0 No 32GB SATA Flash Drive SFDK003L
   /dev/ada1 No 32GB SATA Flash Drive SFDK003L
   /dev/da0 E Micron_5N/A U402
   /dev/da1 E Micron_5N/A U402
   /dev/da12 E SEAGATE XS3840TE70014 0103
   /dev/da13 E SEAGATE XS3840TE70014 0103
   /dev/da14 E SEAGATE XS3840TE70014 0103
   /dev/da2 E Micron_5N/A U402
   /dev/da3 E Micron_5N/A U402
   /dev/da4 E Micron_5N/A U402
   /dev/da5 E Micron_5N/A U402
   /dev/da6 E Micron_5N/A U402
   /dev/da9 E Micron_5N/A U402
   No more disks present ending scan
   root@truenas:~ #


7.4.2.3.1. TCG-Opal Instructions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Reset the password without losing data: "sedutil-cli --revertNoErase
*oldpassword* /dev/*device*"

Use **both** of these commands to change the password without
destroying data:

   "sedutil-cli --setSIDPassword *oldpassword* *newpassword* /dev/*device*"
   "sedutil-cli --setPassword *oldpassword* Admin1 *newpassword* /dev/*device*"

Wipe data and reset password to default MSID: "sedutil-cli --revertPer
*oldpassword* /dev/*device*"

Wipe data and reset password using the PSID: "sedutil-cli

/dev/*device*" where *PSINODASHED* is the PSID located on the pysical
drive with no dashes ("-").


7.4.2.3.2. TCG-E Instructions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Use **all** of these commands to reset the password without losing
data:

   "sedutil-cli --setSIDPassword *oldpassword* "" /dev/*device*"
   "sedutil-cli --setPassword *oldpassword* EraseMaster "" /dev/*device*"
   "sedutil-cli --setPassword *oldpassword* BandMaster0 "" /dev/*device*"
   "sedutil-cli --setPassword *oldpassword* BandMaster1 "" /dev/*device*"

Use **all** of these commands to change the password without
destroying data:

   "sedutil-cli --setSIDPassword *oldpassword* *newpassword* /dev/*device*"
   "sedutil-cli --setPassword *oldpassword* EraseMaster *newpassword* /dev/*device*"
   "sedutil-cli --setPassword *oldpassword* BandMaster0 *newpassword* /dev/*device*"
   "sedutil-cli --setPassword *oldpassword* BandMaster1 *newpassword* /dev/*device*"

Wipe data and reset password to default MSID:

   "sedutil-cli --eraseLockingRange 0 *password* /dev/<device>"
   "sedutil-cli --setSIDPassword *oldpassword* "" /dev/<device>"
   "sedutil-cli --setPassword *oldpassword* EraseMaster "" /dev/<device>"

Wipe data and reset password using the PSID: "sedutil-cli
--yesIreallywanttoERASEALLmydatausingthePSID *PSINODASHED*
/dev/*device*" where *PSINODASHED* is the PSID located on the pysical
drive with no dashes ("-").


7.5. Email
==========

An automatic script sends a nightly email to the *root* user account
containing important information such as the health of the disks.
Alert events are also emailed to the *root* user account. Problems
with Scrub Tasks are reported separately in an email sent at 03:00AM.

Note:

  S.M.A.R.T. reports are mailed separately to the address configured
  in that service.

The administrator typically does not read email directly on the
FreeNAS^® system. Instead, these emails are usually sent to an
external email address where they can be read more conveniently. It is
important to configure the system so it can send these emails to the
administrator's remote email account so they are aware of problems or
status changes.

The first step is to set the remote address where email will be sent.
Go to Accounts ‣ Users, click  (Options) and Edit for the *root*
user. In the Email field, enter the email address on the remote system
where email is to be sent, like *admin@example.com*. Click SAVE to
save the settings.

Additional configuration is performed with System ‣ Email, shown in
Figure %s.

Click the SEND TEST MAIL button to verify that the configured email
settings are working. If the test email fails, double-check that the
Email field of the *root* user is correctly configured by clicking the
Edit button for the *root* account in Accounts ‣ Users.

Configuring email for TLS/SSL email providers is described in Are you
having trouble getting FreeNAS to email you in Gmail?.


7.6. System Dataset
===================

System ‣ System Dataset, shown in Figure %s, is used to select the
pool which contains the persistent system dataset. The system dataset
stores debugging core files, encryption keys for encrypted pools, and
Samba4 metadata such as the user/group cache and share level
permissions.

   [image]System Dataset Screen

Use the System Dataset Pool drop-down menu to select the volume (pool)
to contain the system dataset. The system dataset can be moved to
unencrypted volumes (pools) or encrypted volumes which do not have
passphrases. If the system dataset is moved to an encrypted volume,
that volume is no longer allowed to be locked or have a passphrase
set.

Moving the system dataset also requires restarting the SMB service. A
dialog warns that the SMB service must be restarted, causing a
temporary outage of any active SMB connections.

System logs can also be stored on the system dataset. Storing this
information on the system dataset is recommended when large amounts of
data is being generated and the system has limited memory or a limited
capacity operating system device.

Set Syslog to store system logs on the system dataset. Leave unset to
store system logs in "/var" on the operating system device.

Click SAVE to save changes.

If the pool storing the system dataset is changed at a later time,
FreeNAS^® migrates the existing data in the system dataset to the new
location.

Note:

  Depending on configuration, the system dataset can occupy a large
  amount of space and receive frequent writes. Do not put the system
  dataset on a flash drive or other media with limited space or write
  life.


7.7. Reporting
==============

This section contains settings to customize some of the reporting
tools. These settings are described in Table %s


Reporting Settings

+-------------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

Changes to Reporting settings clear the report history. To keep
history with the old settings, cancel the warning dialog. Click RESET
TO DEFAULTS to restore the original settings.


7.8. Alert Services
===================

FreeNAS^® can use a number of methods to notify the administrator of
system events that require attention. These events are system Alerts.

Available alert services:

* AWS-SNS

* E-mail

* InfluxDB

* Mattermost

* OpsGenie

* PagerDuty

* Slack

Warning:

  These alert services might use a third party commercial vendor not
  directly affiliated with iXsystems. Please investigate and fully
  understand that vendor's pricing policies and services before using
  their alert service. iXsystems is not responsible for any charges
  incurred from the use of third party vendors with the Alert Services
  feature.

Select System ‣ Alert Services to show the Alert Services screen,
Figure %s.

   [image]Alert Services

Click ADD to display the Add Alert Service form, Figure %s.

   [image]Add Alert Service

Select the Type to choose an alert service to configure.

Alert services can be set for a particular severity Level. All alerts
of that level are then sent out with that alert service. For example,
if the *E-Mail* alert service Level is set to *Info*, any *Info* level
alerts are sent by that service. Multiple alert services can be set to
the same level. For instance, *Critical* alerts can be sent both by
email and PagerDuty by setting both alert services to the *Critical*
level.

The configurable fields and required information differ for each alert
service. Set Enabled to activate the service. Enter any other required
information and click SAVE.

Click SEND TEST ALERT to test the chosen alert service.

All saved alert services are displayed in System ‣ Alert Services. To
delete an alert service, click  (Options) and Delete. To disable an
alert service temporarily, click  (Options) and Edit, then unset the
Enabled option.


7.9. Alert Settings
===================

System ‣ Alert Settings has options to configure each FreeNAS^® Alert.

   [image]Alert Settings

Alerts are grouped by web interface feature or service monitor. To
customize alert importance, use the Warning Level drop-down. To adjust
how often alert notifications are sent, use the Frequency drop-down.
Setting the Frequency to *NEVER* prevents that alert from being added
to alert notifications, but the alert can still show in the web
interface if it is triggered.

To configure where alert notifications are sent, use Alert Services.


7.10. Cloud Credentials
=======================

FreeNAS^® can use cloud services for features like Cloud Sync Tasks.
The rclone credentials to provide secure connections with cloud
services are entered here. Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Box, Dropbox, FTP,
Google Cloud Storage, Google Drive, HTTP, hubiC, Mega, Microsoft Azure
Blob Storage, Microsoft OneDrive, pCloud, SFTP, WebDAV, and Yandex are
available.

Note:

  The hubiC cloud service has suspended creation of new accounts.

Warning:

  Cloud Credentials are stored in encrypted form. To be able to
  restore Cloud Credentials from a saved configuration, "Export
  Password Secret Seed" must be set when saving that configuration.

Click System ‣ Cloud Credentials to see the screen shown in Figure %s.

   [image]Cloud Credentials List

The list shows the Account Name and Provider for each credential.
There are options to Edit and Delete a credential after clicking 
(Options) for a credential.

Click ADD to add a new cloud credential. Choose a Provider to display
any specific options for that provider. Figure %s shows an example
configuration:

   [image]Add Amazon S3 Credential

Enter a descriptive and unique name for the cloud credential in the
Name field. The remaining options vary by Provider, and are shown in
Table %s. Clicking a provider name opens a new browser tab to the
rclone documentation for that provider.

For Amazon S3, Access Key and Secret Key values are found on the
Amazon AWS website by clicking on the account name, then My Security
Credentials and Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).
Copy the Access Key value to the FreeNAS^® Cloud Credential Access Key
field, then enter the Secret Key value saved when the key pair was
created. If the Secret Key value is unknown, a new key pair can be
created on the same Amazon screen.

Open Authentication (OAuth) is used with some cloud providers. These
providers have a LOGIN TO PROVIDER button that opens a dialog to log
in to that provider and fill the Access Token field with valid
credentials.

Enter the information and click VERIFY CREDENTIAL. "The Credential is
valid." displays when the credential information is verified.

More details about individual Provider settings are available in the
rclone documentation.


7.11. SSH Connections
=====================

Secure Socket Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that provides a secure
method to access and transfer files between two hosts while using an
unsecure network. SSH can use user account credentials to establish
secure connections, but often uses key pairs shared between host
systems for authentication.

FreeNAS^® uses System ‣ SSH Connections to quickly create SSH
connections and show any saved connections. These connections are
required when creating a new replication to back up dataset snapshots.

The remote system must be configured to allow SSH connections. Some
situations can also require allowing root account access to the remote
system. For FreeNAS^® systems, go to Services and edit the SSH service
to allow SSH connections and root account access.

To add a new SSH connection, go to System ‣ SSH Connections and click
ADD.

Saved connections can be edited or deleted. Deleting an SSH connection
also deletes or disables paired SSH Keypairs, Replication Tasks, and
Cloud Credentials.


7.11.1. Manual Setup
--------------------

Choosing to manually set up the SSH connection requires copying a
public encryption key from the local to remote system. This allows a
secure connection without a password prompt.

The examples here and in Semi-Automatic Setup refer to the FreeNAS^®
system that is configuring a new connection in System ‣ SSH
Connections as *Host 1*. The FreeNAS^® system that is receiving the
encryption key is *Host 2*.

On *Host 1*, go to System ‣ SSH Keypairs and create a new SSH Keypair.
Highlight the entire Public Key text, right-click in the highlighted
area, and click Copy.

Log in to *Host 2* and go to Accounts ‣ Users. Click  (Options) for
the *root* account, then Edit. Paste the copied key into the SSH
Public Key field and click SAVE as shown in Figure %s.

   [image]Paste the Replication Key

Switch back to *Host 1* and go to System ‣ SSH Connections and click
ADD. Set the Setup Method to *Manual*, select the previously created
keypair as the Private Key, and fill in the rest of the connection
details for *Host 2*. Click DISCOVER REMOTE HOST KEY to obtain the
remote system key. Click SAVE to store this SSH connection.


7.11.2. Semi-Automatic Setup
----------------------------

FreeNAS^® offers a semi-automatic setup mode that simplifies setting
up an SSH connection with another FreeNAS or TrueNAS system. When
administrator account credentials are known for *Host 2*, semi-
automatic setup allows configuring the SSH connection without logging
in to *Host 2* to transfer SSH keys.

In *Host 1*, go to System ‣ SSH Keypairs and create a new SSH Keypair.
Go to System ‣ SSH Connections and click ADD.

Choose *Semi-automatic* as the Setup Method. Enter the *Host 2* URL in
FreeNAS URL using the format "http://*freenas.remote*", where
*freenas.remote* is the *Host 2* hostname or IP address.

Enter credentials for an *Host 2* user account that can accept SSH
connection requests and modify *Host 2*. This is typically the *root*
account.

Select the SSH keypair that was just created for the Private Key.

Fill in the remaining connection configuration fields and click SAVE.
*Host 1* can use this saved configuration to establish a connection to
*Host 2* and exchange the remaining authentication keys.


7.12. SSH Keypairs
==================

FreeNAS^® generates and stores RSA-encrypted SSH public and private
keypairs in System ‣ SSH Keypairs. These are generally used when
configuring SSH Connections or *SFTP* Cloud Credentials. Encrypted
keypairs or keypairs with passphrases are not supported.

To generate a new keypair, click ADD, enter a name, and click GENERATE
KEYPAIR. The Private Key and Public Key fields fill with the key
strings. SSH key pair names must be unique.

   [image]Example Keypair

Click SAVE to store the new keypair. These saved keypairs can be
selected later in the web interface wihout having to manually copy the
key values.

Keys are viewed or modified by going to System ‣ SSH Keypairs and
clicking  (Options) and Edit for the keypair name.

Deleting an SSH Keypair also deletes any associated SSH Connections.
Replication Tasks or SFTP Cloud Credentials that use this keypair are
disabled but not removed.


7.13. Tunables
==============

System ‣ Tunables can be used to manage:

1. **FreeBSD sysctls:** a sysctl(8) makes changes to the FreeBSD
   kernel running on a FreeNAS^® system and can be used to tune the
   system.

2. **FreeBSD loaders:** a loader is only loaded when a FreeBSD-based
   system boots and can be used to pass a parameter to the kernel or
   to load an additional kernel module such as a FreeBSD hardware
   driver.

3. **FreeBSD rc.conf options:** rc.conf(5) is used to pass system
   configuration options to the system startup scripts as the system
   boots. Since FreeNAS^® has been optimized for storage, not all of
   the services mentioned in rc.conf(5) are available for
   configuration. Note that in FreeNAS^®, customized rc.conf options
   are stored in "/tmp/rc.conf.freenas".

Warning:

  Adding a sysctl, loader, or "rc.conf" option is an advanced feature.
  A sysctl immediately affects the kernel running the FreeNAS^® system
  and a loader could adversely affect the ability of the FreeNAS^®
  system to successfully boot. **Do not create a tunable on a
  production system before testing the ramifications of that change.**

Since sysctl, loader, and rc.conf values are specific to the kernel
parameter to be tuned, the driver to be loaded, or the service to
configure, descriptions and suggested values can be found in the man
page for the specific driver and in many sections of the FreeBSD
Handbook.

To add a loader, sysctl, or "rc.conf" option, go to System ‣ Tunables
and click ADD to access the screen shown in Figure %s.

   [image]Adding a Tunable

Table %s summarizes the options when adding a tunable.


Adding a Tunable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+---------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Setting       | Value               | Description                                                                           |
|===============|=====================|=======================================================================================|
| Variable      | string              | The name of the sysctl or driver to load.                                             |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Value         | integer or string   | Set a value for the Variable. Refer to the man page for the specific driver or the    |
|               |                     | FreeBSD Handbook for suggested values.                                                |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type          | drop-down menu      | Choices are *Loader*, *rc.conf*, and *Sysctl*.                                        |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Description   | string              | Optional. Enter a description of this tunable.                                        |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Enabled       | checkbox            | Deselect this option to disable the tunable without deleting it.                      |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note:

  As soon as a *Sysctl* is added or edited, the running kernel changes
  that variable to the value specified. However, when a *Loader* or
  *rc.conf* value is changed, it does not take effect until the system
  is rebooted. Regardless of the type of tunable, changes persist at
  each boot and across upgrades unless the tunable is deleted or the
  Enabled option is deselected.

Existing tunables are listed in System ‣ Tunables. To change the value
of an existing tunable, click  (Options) and Edit. To remove a
tunable, click  (Options) and Delete.

Restarting the FreeNAS^® system after making sysctl changes is
recommended. Some sysctls only take effect at system startup, and
restarting the system guarantees that the setting values correspond
with what is being used by the running system.

The web interface does not display the sysctls that are pre-set when
FreeNAS^® is installed. FreeNAS^® 11.3 ships with the sysctls set:

   kern.corefile=/var/tmp/%N.core
   kern.metadelay=3
   kern.dirdelay=4
   kern.filedelay=5
   kern.coredump=1
   kern.sugid_coredump=1
   vfs.timestamp_precision=3
   net.link.lagg.lacp.default_strict_mode=0
   vfs.zfs.min_auto_ashift=12

**Do not add or edit these default sysctls** as doing so may render
the system unusable.

The web interface does not display the loaders that are pre-set when
FreeNAS^® is installed. FreeNAS^® 11.3 ships with these loaders set:

   product="FreeNAS"
   autoboot_delay="5"
   loader_logo="FreeNAS"
   loader_menu_title="Welcome to FreeNAS"
   loader_brand="FreeNAS"
   loader_version=" "
   kern.cam.boot_delay="30000"
   debug.debugger_on_panic=1
   debug.ddb.textdump.pending=1
   hw.hptrr.attach_generic=0
   vfs.mountroot.timeout="30"
   ispfw_load="YES"
   ipmi_load="YES"
   freenas_sysctl_load="YES"
   hint.isp.0.role=2
   hint.isp.1.role=2
   hint.isp.2.role=2
   hint.isp.3.role=2
   module_path="/boot/kernel;/boot/modules;/usr/local/modules"
   net.inet6.ip6.auto_linklocal="0"
   vfs.zfs.vol.mode=2
   kern.geom.label.disk_ident.enable=0
   kern.geom.label.ufs.enable=0
   kern.geom.label.ufsid.enable=0
   kern.geom.label.reiserfs.enable=0
   kern.geom.label.ntfs.enable=0
   kern.geom.label.msdosfs.enable=0
   kern.geom.label.ext2fs.enable=0
   hint.ahciem.0.disabled="1"
   hint.ahciem.1.disabled="1"
   kern.msgbufsize="524288"
   hw.mfi.mrsas_enable="1"
   hw.usb.no_shutdown_wait=1
   vfs.nfsd.fha.write=0
   vfs.nfsd.fha.max_nfsds_per_fh=32
   vm.lowmem_period=0

**Do not add or edit the default tunables.** Changing the default
tunables can make the system unusable.

The ZFS version used in 11.3 deprecates these tunables:

   kvfs.zfs.write_limit_override
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_inflated
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_max
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_min
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_shift
   vfs.zfs.no_write_throttle

After upgrading from an earlier version of FreeNAS^®, these tunables
are automatically deleted. Please do not manually add them back.


7.14. Update
============

FreeNAS^® has an integrated update system to make it easy to keep up
to date.


7.14.1. Preparing for Updates
-----------------------------

It is best to perform updates at times the FreeNAS^® system is idle,
with no clients connected and no scrubs or other disk activity going
on. Most updates require a system reboot. Plan updates around
scheduled maintenance times to avoid disrupting user activities.

The update process will not proceed unless there is enough free space
in the boot pool for the new update files. If a space warning is
shown, go to Boot to remove unneeded boot environments.


7.14.2. Updates and Trains
--------------------------

Cryptographically signed update files are used to update FreeNAS^®.
Update files provide flexibility in deciding when to upgrade the
system. Go to Boot to test an update.

FreeNAS^® defines software branches, known as *trains*. There are
several trains available for updates, but the web interface only
displays trains that can be selected as an upgrade.

Update trains are labeled with a numeric version followed by a short
description. The current version receives regular bug fixes and new
features. Supported older versions of FreeNAS^® only receive
maintenance updates. Several specific words are used to describe the
type of train:

* **STABLE:** Bug fixes and new features are available from this
  train. Upgrades available from a *STABLE* train are tested and ready
  to apply to a production environment.

* **Nightlies:**  Experimental train used for testing future versions
  of FreeNAS^®.

* **SDK:** Software Developer Kit train. This has additional tools for
  testing and debugging FreeNAS^®.

Warning:

  The UI will warn if the currently selected train is not suited for
  production use. Before using a non-production train, be prepared to
  experience bugs or problems. Testers are encouraged to submit bug
  reports at https://bugs.ixsystems.com.


7.14.3. Checking for Updates
----------------------------

Figure %s shows an example of the System ‣ Update screen.

   [image]Update Options

The system checks daily for updates and downloads an update if one is
available. An alert is issued when a new update becomes available. The
automatic check and download of updates is disabled by unsetting Check
for Updates Daily and Download if Available. Click  (Refresh) to
perform another check for updates.

To change the train, use the drop-down menu to make a different
selection.

Note:

  The train selector does not allow downgrades. For example, the
  STABLE train cannot be selected while booted into a Nightly boot
  environment, or a 9.10 train cannot be selected while booted into a
  11 boot environment. To go back to an earlier version after testing
  or running a more recent version, reboot and select a boot
  environment for that earlier version. This screen can then be used
  to check for updates that train.

In the example shown in Figure %s, information about the update is
displayed along with a link to the release notes. It is important to
read the release notes before updating to determine if any of the
changes in that release impact the use of the system.

   [image]Reviewing Updates


7.14.4. Saving the Configuration File
-------------------------------------

A dialog to save the system configuration file appears before
installing updates.

   [image]

Warning:

  Keep the system configuration file secure after saving it. The
  security information in the configuration file could be used for
  unauthorized access to the FreeNAS^® system.


7.14.5. Applying Updates
------------------------

Make sure the system is in a low-usage state as described above in
Preparing for Updates.

Click DOWNLOAD UPDATES to immediately download and install an update.

The Save Configuration dialog appears so the current configuration can
be saved to external media.

A confirmation window appears before the update is installed. When
Apply updates and reboot system after downloading is set and, clicking
CONTINUE downloads, applies the updates, and then automatically
reboots the system. The update can be downloaded for a later manual
installation by unsetting the Apply updates and reboot system after
downloading option.

APPLY PENDING UPDATE is visible when an update is downloaded and ready
to install. Click the button to see a confirmation window. Setting
Confirm and clicking CONTINUE installs the update and reboots the
system.

Warning:

  Each update creates a boot environment. If the update process needs
  more space, it attempts to remove old boot environments. Boot
  environments marked with the *Keep* attribute as shown in Boot are
  not removed. If space for a new boot environment is not available,
  the upgrade fails. Space on the operating system device can be
  manually freed using System ‣ Boot. Review the boot environments and
  remove the *Keep* attribute or delete any boot environments that are
  no longer needed.


7.14.6. Manual Updates
----------------------

Updates can also be manually downloaded and applied in System ‣
Update.

Note:

  Manual updates cannot be used to upgrade from older major versions.

Go to https://download.freenas.org/ and find an update file of the
desired version. Manual update file names end with "-manual-update-
unsigned.tar".

Download the file to a desktop or laptop computer. Connect to
FreeNAS^® with a browser and go to System ‣ Update. Click INSTALL
MANUAL UPDATE FILE.

The Save Configuration dialog opens. This makes it possible to save a
copy of the current configuration to external media for backup in case
of an update problem.

After the dialog closes, the manual update screen is shown:

   [image]

The current version of FreeNAS^® is shown for verification.

Select the manual update file with the Browse button. Set Reboot After
Update to reboot the system after the update has been installed. Click
APPLY UPDATE to begin the update.


7.14.7. Update in Progress
--------------------------

Starting an update shows a progress dialog. When an update is in
progress, the web interface shows an  icon in the top row. Dialogs
also appear in every active web interface session to warn that a
system update is in progress. **Do not** interrupt a system update.


7.15. CAs
=========

FreeNAS^® can act as a Certificate Authority (CA). When encrypting SSL
or TLS connections to the FreeNAS^® system, either import an existing
certificate, or create a CA on the FreeNAS^® system, then create a
certificate. This certificate will appear in the drop-down menus for
services that support SSL or TLS.

For secure LDAP, the public key of an existing CA can be imported with
Import CA, or a new CA created on the FreeNAS^® system and used on the
LDAP server also.

Figure %s shows the screen after clicking System ‣ CAs.

   [image]Initial CA Screen

If the organization already has a CA, the CA certificate and key can
be imported. Click ADD and set the Type to *Import CA* to see the
configuration options shown in Figure %s. The configurable options are
summarized in Table %s.

+------------------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

To create a new CA, first decide if it will be the only CA which will
sign certificates for internal use or if the CA will be part of a
certificate chain.

To create a CA for internal use only, click ADD and set the Type to
*Internal CA*. Figure %s shows the available options.

   [image]Creating an Internal CA

The configurable options are described in Table %s. When completing
the fields for the certificate authority, supply the information for
the organization.

To create an intermediate CA which is part of a certificate chain, set
the Type to *Intermediate CA*. This screen adds one more option to the
screen shown in Figure %s:

* **Signing Certificate Authority:** this drop-down menu is used to
  specify the root CA in the certificate chain. This CA must first be
  imported or created.

Imported or created CAs are added as entries in System ‣ CAs. The
columns in this screen indicate the name of the CA, whether it is an
internal CA, whether the issuer is self-signed, the CA lifetime (in
days), the common name of the CA, the date and time the CA was
created, and the date and time the CA expires.

Click  (Options) on an existing CA to access these configuration
buttons:

* **View:** use this option to view the contents of an existing
  Certificate, Private Key, or to edit the Identifier.

* **Sign CSR:** used to sign internal Certificate Signing Requests
  created using System ‣ Certificates ‣ Create CSR. Signing a request
  adds a new certificate to System ‣ Certificates.

* **Export Certificate:** prompts to browse to the location to save a
  copy of the CA's X.509 certificate on the computer being used to
  access the FreeNAS^® system.

* **Export Private Key:** prompts to browse to the location to save a
  copy of the CA's private key on the computer being used to access
  the FreeNAS^® system. This option only appears if the CA has a
  private key.

* **Delete:** prompts for confirmation before deleting the CA.


7.16. Certificates
==================

FreeNAS^® can import existing certificates or certificate signing
requests, create new certificates, and issue certificate signing
requests so that created certificates can be signed by the CA which
was previously imported or created in CAs.

Go to System ‣ Certificates to add or view certificates.

   [image]Certificates

FreeNAS^® uses a self-signed certificate to enable encrypted access to
the web interface. This certificate is generated at boot and cannot be
deleted until a different certificate is chosen as the GUI SSL
Certificate.

To import an existing certificate, click ADD and set the Type to
*Import Certificate*. Figure %s shows the options. When importing a
certificate chain, paste the primary certificate, followed by any
intermediate certificates, followed by the root CA certificate.

The configurable options are summarized in Table %s.

To create a new self-signed certificate, set the Type to *Internal
Certificate* to see the options shown in Figure %s. The configurable
options are summarized in Table %s. When completing the fields for the
certificate authority, use the information for the organization. Since
this is a self-signed certificate, use the CA that was imported or
created with CAs as the signing authority.

If the certificate is signed by an external CA, such as Verisign,
instead create a certificate signing request. To do so, set the Type
to *Certificate Signing Request*. The options from Figure %s display,
but without the Signing Certificate Authority and Lifetime fields.

Certificates that are imported, self-signed, or for which a
certificate signing request is created are added as entries to System
‣ Certificates. In the example shown in Figure %s, a self-signed
certificate and a certificate signing request have been created for
the fictional organization *My Company*. The self-signed certificate
was issued by the internal CA named *My Company* and the administrator
has not yet sent the certificate signing request to Verisign so that
it can be signed. Once that certificate is signed and returned by the
external CA, it should be imported with a new certificate set to
*Import Certificate*. This makes the certificate available as a
configurable option for encrypting connections.

   [image]Managing Certificates

Clicking  (Options) for an entry shows these configuration buttons:

* **View:** use this option to view the contents of an existing
  Certificate, Private Key, or to edit the Identifier.

* **Create ACME Certificate:** use an ACME DNS authenticator to
  verify, issue, and renew a certificate. Only visible with
  certificate signing requests.

* **Export Certificate** saves a copy of the certificate or
  certificate signing request to the system being used to access the
  FreeNAS^® system. For a certificate signing request, send the
  exported certificate to the external signing authority so that it
  can be signed.

* **Export Private Key** saves a copy of the private key associated
  with the certificate or certificate signing request to the system
  being used to access the FreeNAS^® system.

* **Delete** is used to delete a certificate or certificate signing
  request.


7.16.1. ACME Certificates
-------------------------

Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is available for
automating certificate issuing and renewal. The user must verify
ownership of the domain before certificate automation is allowed.

ACME certificates can be created for existing certificate signing
requests. These certificates use an ACME DNS authenticator to confirm
domain ownership, then are automatically issued and renewed. To create
a new ACME certificate, go to System ‣ Certificates, click  (Options)
for an existing certificate signing request, and click Create ACME
Certificate.

solve it. When similar issues are *Closed* or *Resolved*, create a new
issue and refer to the previous issue.

Note:

  Update the system to the latest version of STABLE and retest before
  reporting an issue. Newer versions of the software might have
  already fixed the problem.

To generate a report using the built-in Support screen, complete these
fields:

* **Username:** enter the login name created when registering at
  https://bugs.ixsystems.com.

* **Password:** enter the password associated with the registered
  login name.

* **Type:** select *Bug* when reporting an issue or *Feature* when
  requesting a new feature.

* **Category:** this drop-down menu is empty until a registered
  Username and Password are entered. The field remains empty if either
  value is incorrect. After the Username and Password are validated,
  possible categories are populated to the drop-down menu. Select the
  one that best describes the bug or feature being reported.

* **Attach Debug:** enabling this option is recommended so an overview
  of the system hardware, build string, and configuration is
  automatically generated and included with the ticket. Generating and
  attaching a debug to the ticket can take some time.

  Debug file attachments are limited to 20 MiB. If the debug file is
  too large to include, unset the option to generate the debug file
  and let the system create an issue ticket as shown below. Manually
  create a debug file by going to System ‣ Advanced and clicking SAVE
  DEBUG.

  Go to the ticket at https://bugs.ixsystems.com and add the debug
  file as a private attachment.

* **Subject:** enter a descriptive title for the ticket. A good
  *Subject* makes it easy to find similar reports.

* **Description:** enter a one- to three-paragraph summary of the
  issue that describes the problem, and if applicable, what steps can
  be taken to reproduce it.

* **Attach screenshots:** select screenshots on the client system to
  include with the report.

Click SUBMIT to automatically generate and upload the report to the
issue tracker (https://bugs.ixsystems.com). This process can take
several minutes while information is collected and sent. All files
included with the report are added to the issue tracker ticket as
private attachments and can only be accessed by the creator of the
ticket and iXsystems.

After the new ticket is created, the ticket URL is shown for viewing
or updating with more information.
