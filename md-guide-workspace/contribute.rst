Translation
-----------

FreeNAS\ :sup:`®` is developed and documented in English. Having
complete translations of the user interface into other languages helps
make FreeNAS\ :sup:`®` much more useful to communities around the
world.

FreeNAS\ :sup:`®` uses :file:`.po` files stored in the
`webui GitHub repository
<https://github.com/freenas/webui/tree/master/src/assets/i18n>`__
to manage the translation of text shown in the FreeNAS\ :sup:`®`
graphical administrative interface. GitHub provides an easy to use
web-based editor, making it possible for individuals to assist with
translation or comment on existing translations.

To view translation files, open the :file:`/src/assets/i18n` directory
of the FreeNAS\ :sup:`®`
`webui repository
<https://github.com/freenas/webui/tree/master/src/assets/i18n>`__,
as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <contribute_po_fig>`.

   FreeNAS\ :sup:`®` Translation Files


To assist with translating FreeNAS\ :sup:`®`, first create an account
with
`GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ and :guilabel:`Fork` the
`freenas/webui <https://github.com/freenas/webui>`__ repository.

There are two methods for committing translations:

1. Use the GitHub website to edit the :file:`.po` files.

OR

2. Make a local copy of the forked repository and use a text editor for
   translations.


Translate with GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open a browser and go to your GitHub profile. Select the
:guilabel:`Repositories` tab and open your fork of the
:literal:`freenas/webui` repository. Click
:menuselection:`src --> assets --> i18n`
to open the translations directory. Click on the desired language
:file:`.po` file to begin translating.

.. tip:: Here is a list of `common language abbreviations
   <https://www.abbreviations.com/acronyms/LANGUAGES2L>`__


Click the :guilabel:`Pencil` icon in the upper right area to open the
online file editor. :numref:`Figure %s <contribute_github_editor_fig>`
shows the page that appears:

   GitHub Online Editor


There are numerous :literal:`msgid ""` and :literal:`msgstr ""`
entries in the file. Read  the :literal:`msgid` text and enter the
translation between the :literal:`msgstr` quotes.

Scroll to the bottom of the page when finished entering translations.
Enter a descriptive title and summary of changes for the edits and click
:guilabel:`Commit changes`.


Download and Translate Offline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Install Git
<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`__.
There are numerous examples in these instructions of using
:command:`git`, but full documentation for :command:`git` is
`available online <https://git-scm.com/doc>`__.

These instructions show using the Command Line Interface (CLI) with
:command:`git`, but many graphical utilities are available.

Create a suitable directory to store the local copy of the forked
repository. Download the repository with :command:`git clone`:

:samp:`% git clone https://github.com/ghuser/webui.git`

The download can take several minutes, depending on connection speed.

Use :command:`cd` to go to the :file:`i18n` directory:

:samp:`% cd src/assets/i18n/`

Use a :file:`po` editor to add translations to the desired language
file. Any capable editor will work, but
`poedit <https://poedit.net/>`__
and
`gtranslator <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gtranslator>`__
are two common options.

Commit any file changes with :command:`git commit`:

:samp:`% git commit ar.po`

Enter a descriptive message about the changes and save the commit.

When finished making commits to the branch, use :command:`git push` to
send your changes to the online fork repository.


Translation Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ready to merge translations in the original :literal:`freenas/webui`
repository, open a web browser and go to your forked repository on
GitHub. Select the :guilabel:`Code` tab and click
:guilabel:`New pull request`. Set the :guilabel:`base repository`
drop-down to :literal:`freenas/webui` and the :guilabel:`head repository`
to your fork. Click :guilabel:`Create pull request`, write a title and
summary of your proposed changes, and click
:guilabel:`Create pull request` again to submit your translations to the
:literal:`freenas/webui` repository.

The FreeNAS\ :sup:`®` project automatically tests pull requests for
compatibility. If there any issues with a pull request, either the
automated system will update the request or a FreeNAS\ :sup:`®` team
member will leave a message in the comment section of the request.

All assistance with translations helps to benefit the FreeNAS\ :sup:`®`
community. Thank you!
