Task Manager
============

The task manager shows a list of tasks performed by the FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` system
starting with the most recent. Click a task name to display its start time, progress, finish time,
and whether the task succeeded. If a task failed, the error status is shown.

Tasks with log file output have a :guilabel:`View Logs` button to show the log files.

The task manager can be opened by clicking ui-task-manager. Close the
task manager by clicking :guilabel:`CLOSE`, clicking anywhere outside
the task manager dialog, or by pressing :kbd:`Esc`.
