IRC

</div>

IRC
---

To ask a question in real time, use the *\#freenas* channel on IRC
[Freenode](http://freenode.net/). Depending on the time of day and the
time zone, FreeNAS<sup>®</sup> developers or other users may be
available to provide assistance. If no one answers right away, remain on
the channel, as other users tend to read the channel history to answer
questions as time permits.

Typically, an IRC
[client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients)
is used to access the *\#freenas* IRC channel. Alternately, use
[webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=freenas) from a web
browser.

To get the most out of the IRC channel, keep these points in mind:

-   Do not ask "Can anyone help me?". Just ask the question.
-   Do not ask a question and leave. Users who know the answer cannot
    help you if you disappear.
-   If no one answers, the question may be difficult to answer or it has
    been asked before. Research other resources while waiting for the
    question to be answered.
-   Do not post error messages in the channel. Instead, use a pasting
    service such as [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and paste the
    resulting URL into the IRC discussion.
