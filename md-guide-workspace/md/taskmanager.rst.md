Task Manager
============

The task manager shows a list of tasks performed by the
FreeNAS<sup>Â®</sup> system starting with the most recent. Click a task
name to display its start time, progress, finish time, and whether the
task succeeded. If a task failed, the error status is shown.

Tasks with log file output have a `View Logs` button to show the log
files.

The task manager can be opened by clicking ui-task-manager. Close the
task manager by clicking `CLOSE`, clicking anywhere outside the task
manager dialog, or by pressing `Esc`.
