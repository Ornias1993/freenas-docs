Network
=======

The Network section of the web interface contains these
components for viewing and configuring network settings on the
FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` system:

* :ref:`Global Configuration`: general network settings.

* :ref:`Interfaces`: settings for each network interface and options
  to configure :ref:`Bridge <Bridges>`,
  :ref:`Link Aggregation <Link Aggregations>`, and :ref:`VLAN <VLANs>`
  interfaces.

* :ref:`IPMI`: settings controlling connection to the appliance
  through the hardware side-band management interface if the
  user interface becomes unavailable.

* :ref:`Static Routes`: add static routes.


Each of these is described in more detail in this section.

.. _webui_interface_warning:

.. note:: When any network changes are made an animated icon appears in the
   upper-right web interface panel to show there are pending network changes.
   When the icon is clicked it prompts to review the recent network
   changes. Reviewing the network changes goes to
   :menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces` where the changes can be
   permanently applied or discarded.
   
   When :guilabel:`APPLY CHANGES` is clicked the network changes are
   temporarily applied for 60 seconds by default. This value can be
   changed by entering a positive integer in the seconds field. This
   feature is nice because the network settings preview can automatically
   roll back any configuration errors that are accidentally saved.

   If the network settings applied work as intended, click
   :guilabel:`KEEP CHANGES`. Otherwise, the changes can be discarded by
   clicking :guilabel:`DISCARD CHANGES`.


.. _Global Configuration:

Global Configuration
--------------------

:menuselection:`Network --> Global Configuration`,
shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <global_net_config_fig>`,
is for general network settings that are not unique to any particular
network interface.

   Global Network Configuration


:numref:`Table %s <global_net_config_tab>`
summarizes the settings on the Global Configuration tab.
:guilabel:`Hostname` and :guilabel:`Domain` fields are pre-filled as
shown in :numref:`Figure %s <global_net_config_fig>`,
but can be changed to meet requirements of the local network.

When using Active Directory, set the IP address of the
realm DNS server in the :guilabel:`Nameserver 1` field.

If the network does not have a DNS server, or NFS, SSH, or FTP users
are receiving "reverse DNS" or timeout errors, add an entry for the IP
address of the FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` system in the :guilabel:`Host name database`
field.

.. _Gateway Note:

.. note:: In many cases, a FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` configuration does not include
   default gateway information as a way to make it more difficult for
   a remote attacker to communicate with the server. While this is a
   reasonable precaution, such a configuration does **not** restrict
   inbound traffic from sources within the local network. However,
   omitting a default gateway will prevent the FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` system from
   communicating with DNS servers, time servers, and mail servers that
   are located outside of the local network. In this case, it is
   recommended to add :ref:`Static Routes` to be able to reach
   external DNS, NTP, and mail servers which are configured with
   static IP addresses. When a gateway to the Internet is added, make
   sure the FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` system is protected by a properly configured
   firewall.


.. _Interfaces:

Interfaces
----------

:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces`
shows all physical Network Interface Controllers (NICs) connected to the
FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` system. These can be edited or new *bridge*, *link aggregation*,
or *Virtual LAN (VLAN)* interfaces can be created and added to the
interface list.

Be careful when configuring the network interface that controls the
FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` web interface or
:ref:`web connectivity can be lost <webui_interface_warning>`.

To configure a new network interface, go to
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces`
and click :guilabel:`ADD`.

Network Bridges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A network bridge allows multiple network interfaces to function as a
single interface.

To create a bridge, go to
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces`
and click :guilabel:`ADD`. Choose *Bridge* as the :guilabel:`Type` and continue
to configure the interface. See the
:ref:`Interface Configuration Options table <net_interface_config_tab>`
for descriptions of each option.

Enter :samp:`bridge{X}` for the :guilabel:`Name`, where *X* is a unique
interface number. Open the :guilabel:`Bridge Members` drop-down menu and
select each interface that will be part of the bridge. Click
:guilabel:`SAVE` to add the new bridge to
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces`
and show options to confirm or revert the new network settings.


.. index:: Link Aggregation, LAGG, LACP, EtherChannel
.. _Link Aggregations:

Link Aggregations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` uses the FreeBSD
`lagg(4) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=lagg>`__
interface to provide link aggregation and link failover support. A
lagg interface allows combining multiple network interfaces into a
single virtual interface. This provides fault-tolerance and high-speed
multi-link throughput. The aggregation protocols supported by lagg both
determines the ports to use for outgoing traffic and if a specific port
accepts incoming traffic. The link state of the lagg interface is used
to validate whether the port is active.

Aggregation works best on switches supporting LACP, which distributes
traffic bi-directionally while responding to failure of individual
links. FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` also supports active/passive failover between pairs of
links. The LACP and load-balance modes select the output interface using
a hash that includes the Ethernet source and destination address, VLAN
tag (if available), IP source and destination address, and flow label
(IPv6 only). The benefit can only be observed when multiple clients are
transferring files *from* the NAS. The flow entering *into* the NAS
depends on the Ethernet switch load-balance algorithm.

The lagg driver currently supports several aggregation protocols,
although only *Failover* is recommended on network switches that do
not support *LACP*:

**Failover:** the default protocol. Sends traffic only through the
active port. If the master port becomes unavailable, the next active
port is used. The first interface added is the master port. Any
interfaces added later are used as failover devices. By default,
received traffic is only accepted when received through the active
port. This constraint can be relaxed, which is useful for certain
bridged network setups, by going to
:menuselection:`System --> Tunables`
and clicking :guilabel:`ADD` to add a tunable. Set the :guilabel:`Variable` to
*net.link.lagg.failover_rx_all*, the :guilabel:`Value` to a non-zero
integer, and the :guilabel:`Type` to *Sysctl*.



**LACP:** supports the IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol
(LACP) and the Marker Protocol. LACP negotiates a set of aggregable
links with the peer into one or more link aggregated groups (LAGs). Each
LAG is composed of ports of the same speed, set to full-duplex
operation. Traffic is balanced across the ports in the LAG with the
greatest total speed. In most situations there will be a single LAG
which contains all ports. In the event of changes in physical
connectivity, link aggregation quickly converges to a new configuration.
LACP must be configured on the network switch and LACP does not support
mixing interfaces of different speeds. Only interfaces that use the same
driver, like two *igb* ports, are recommended for LACP. Using LACP for
iSCSI is not recommended as iSCSI has built-in multipath features which
are more efficient.

.. note:: When using *LACP*, verify the switch is configured for active
   LACP. Passive LACP is not supported.


**Load Balance:** balances outgoing traffic across the active ports
based on hashed protocol header information and accepts incoming traffic
from any active port. This is a static setup and does not negotiate
aggregation with the peer or exchange frames to monitor the link. The
hash includes the Ethernet source and destination address, VLAN tag (if
available), and IP source and destination address. Requires a switch
which supports IEEE 802.3ad static link aggregation.

**Round Robin:** distributes outgoing traffic using a round-robin
scheduler through all active ports and accepts incoming traffic from
any active port. This mode can cause unordered packet arrival at the
client. This has a side effect of limiting throughput as reordering
packets can be CPU intensive on the client. Requires a switch which
supports IEEE 802.3ad static link aggregation.

**None:** this protocol disables any traffic without disabling the
lagg interface itself.


.. _LACP, MPIO, NFS, and ESXi:

LACP, MPIO, NFS, and ESXi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LACP bonds Ethernet connections to improve bandwidth. For example,
four physical interfaces can be used to create one mega interface.
However, it cannot increase the bandwidth for a single conversation.
It is designed to increase bandwidth when multiple clients are
simultaneously accessing the same system. It also assumes that quality
Ethernet hardware is used and it will not make much difference when
using inferior Ethernet chipsets such as a Realtek.

LACP reads the sender and receiver IP addresses and, if they are
deemed to belong to the same TCP connection, always sends the packet
over the same interface to ensure that TCP does not need to reorder
packets. This makes LACP ideal for load balancing many simultaneous
TCP connections, but does nothing for increasing the speed over one
TCP connection.

MPIO operates at the iSCSI protocol level. For example, if four IP
addresses are created and there are four simultaneous TCP connections,
MPIO will send the data over all available links. When configuring
MPIO, make sure that the IP addresses on the interfaces are configured
to be on separate subnets with non-overlapping netmasks, or configure
static routes to do point-to-point communication. Otherwise, all
packets will pass through one interface.

LACP and other forms of link aggregation generally do not work well
with virtualization solutions. In a virtualized environment, consider
the use of iSCSI MPIO through the creation of an iSCSI Portal with at
least two network cards on different networks. This allows an iSCSI
initiator to recognize multiple links to a target, using them for
increased bandwidth or redundancy. This
`how-to
<https://fojta.wordpress.com/2010/04/13/iscsi-and-esxi-multipathing-and-jumbo-frames/>`__
contains instructions for configuring MPIO on ESXi.

NFS does not understand MPIO. Therefore, one fast interface is needed,
since creating an iSCSI portal will not improve bandwidth when using
NFS. LACP does not work well to increase the bandwidth for
point-to-point NFS (one server and one client). LACP is a good
solution for link redundancy or for one server and many clients.


.. _Creating a Link Aggregation:

Creating a Link Aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Before** creating a link aggregation, see this
:ref:`warning <webui_interface_warning>` about changing the interface
that the web interface uses.

To create a link aggregation, go to
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces`
and click :guilabel:`ADD`. Choose *Link Aggregation* as the :guilabel:`Type`
and continue to fill in the remaining configuration options. See the
:ref:`Interface Configuration Options table <net_interface_config_tab>`
for descriptions of each option.

Enter :samp:`lagg{X}` for the :guilabel:`Name`, where *X* is a unique
interface number. There a several :guilabel:`Lagg Protocol` options, but
*LACP* is preferred. Choose *Failover* when the network switch does not
support LACP. Open the :guilabel:`Lagg Interfaces` drop-down menu to
associate NICs with the lagg device. Click :guilabel:`SAVE` to add the
new aggregation to
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces`
and show options to confirm or revert the new network settings.

.. note:: If interfaces are installed but do not appear in the
   :guilabel:`Lagg Interfaces` list, check for a `FreeBSD driver
   <https://www.freebsd.org/releases/11.2R/hardware.html#ethernet>`__
   for the interface.


Link Aggregation Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Options are set at the lagg level from
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces`.
Find the lagg interface, expand the entry with ui-chevron-right, and
click ui-edit. Scroll to the :guilabel:`Options` field. Changes are
typically made at the lagg level as each interface member inherits
settings from the lagg. Configuring at the interface level requires
repeating the configuration for each interface within the lagg. Setting
options at the individual interface level is done by editing the parent
interface in the same way as the lagg interface.

.. _LAGG MTU:

If the MTU settings on the lagg member interfaces are not identical,
the smallest value is used for the MTU of the entire lagg.

.. note:: A reboot is required after changing the MTU to create a
   jumbo frame lagg.


Link aggregation load balancing can be tested with:

.. code-block:: none

   systat -ifstat


More information about this command can be found at
`systat(1) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=systat>`__.


.. index:: VLAN, Trunking, 802.1Q
.. _VLANs:

VLANs
~~~~~

FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` uses
`vlan(4) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vlan>`__
to demultiplex frames with IEEE 802.1q tags. This allows nodes on
different VLANs to communicate through a layer 3 switch or router. A
vlan interface must be assigned a parent interface and a numeric VLAN
tag. A single parent can be assigned to multiple vlan interfaces
provided they have different tags.

.. note:: VLAN tagging is the only 802.1q feature that is implemented.
   Additionally, not all Ethernet interfaces support full VLAN
   processing.  See the HARDWARE section of
   `vlan(4) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vlan>`__
   for details.


To add a new VLAN interface, go to
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces`
and click :guilabel:`ADD`. Choose *VLAN* as the :guilabel:`Type` and continue
filling in the remaining fields. See the
:ref:`Interface Configuration Options table <net_interface_config_tab>`
for descriptions of each option.

The parent interface of a VLAN must be up, but it can either have an IP
address or be unconfigured, depending upon the requirements of the VLAN
configuration. This makes it difficult for the web interface to do the right
thing without trampling the configuration. To remedy this, add the VLAN
interface, then select
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces`, and click ui-options and
:guilabel:`Edit` for the parent interface. Enter :command:`up` in the
:guilabel:`Options` field and click :guilabel:`SAVE`. This brings up the
parent interface. If an IP address is required, configure it using the
rest of the options in the edit screen.

.. warning:: Creating a VLAN causes an interruption to network
   connectivity. The web interface requires confirming the new network
   configuration before it is permanently applied to the FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` system.


.. _IPMI:

IPMI
----

Beginning with version 9.2.1, FreeNAS\ :sup:`Â®` provides a graphical screen for
configuring an IPMI interface. This screen will only appear if the
system hardware includes a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).

IPMI provides side-band management if the graphical administrative
interface becomes unresponsive. This allows for a few vital functions,
such as checking the log, accessing the BIOS setup, and powering on
the system without requiring physical access to the system. IPMI is
also used to give another person remote access to the system to
assist with a configuration or troubleshooting issue. Before
configuring IPMI, ensure that the management interface is physically
connected to the network. The IPMI device may share the primary
Ethernet interface, or it may be a dedicated separate IPMI interface.

.. warning:: It is recommended to first ensure that the IPMI has been
   patched against the Remote Management Vulnerability before enabling
   IPMI. This
   `article
   <https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/how-to-fix-the-ipmi-remote-management-vulnerability/>`__
   provides more information about the vulnerability and how to fix
   it.


.. note:: Some IPMI implementations require updates to work with newer
   versions of Java. See
   `PSA: Java 8 Update 131 breaks ASRock's IPMI Virtual console
   <https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/psa-java-8-update-131-breaks-asrocks-ipmi-virtual-console.53911/>`__
   for more information.


IPMI is configured from
:menuselection:`Network --> IPMI`.
The IPMI configuration screen, shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <ipmi_config_fig>`,
provides a shortcut to the most basic IPMI configuration. Those
already familiar with IPMI management tools can use them instead.
:numref:`Table %s <ipmi_options_tab>`

After configuration, the IPMI interface is accessed using a web
browser and the IP address specified in the configuration. The
management interface prompts for a username and the configured
password. Refer to the IPMI device documentation to determine the
default administrative username.

After logging in to the management interface, the default
administrative username can be changed, and additional users created.
The appearance of the IPMI utility and the functions that are
available vary depending on the hardware.
